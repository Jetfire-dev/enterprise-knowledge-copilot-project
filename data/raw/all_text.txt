ASSESSMENT AND PROSPECTS1ASSESSMENT AND PROSPECTSITHE ANNUAL REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE RESERVE BANK OF INDIA
For the Year April 1, 2023 to March 31, 2024*
PART ONE: THE ECONOMY - REVIEW AND PROSPECTS
I.1 The global economy is exhibiting 
resilience and fortitude. There are, however, 
multiple challenges emanating from still 
elevated inflation, tight monetary and financial 
conditions, escalating geopolitical tensions, rising 
geoeconomic fragmentation, disruptions in key 
global shipping routes, high public debt burdens 
and financial stability risks. Amidst heightened 
uncertainty, global growth is likely to weaken 
below its historical average in 2024, with divergent 
and uneven pathways across geographies and 
sectors. Global financial markets are on edge, 
with recurrent bouts of volatility as every incoming 
data increases uncertainty around monetary 
policy trajectories of major central banks.
I.2 Inflation is easing but rules above target 
in major systemic economies. The outlook for 
further disinflation is impeded by sticky core and 
services inflation and tight labour markets. While 
major advanced economy (AE) central banks 
are expected to pivot towards rate cuts in 2024, 
the fuzzy inflation trajectory is leading to sharp 
gyrations in market expectations of the pace and 
timing of monetary policy easing. In this milieu, 
several emerging market economies (EMEs)1 
have started rate cutting cycle and major AEs 
are undertaking regime shifts including exits from 
negative policy rates.I.3 Amidst this challenging global economic 
environment, the Indian economy is exhibiting 
strength and stability with robust macroeconomic 
fundamentals and financial stability. India has 
emerged as the fastest growing major economy 
in the world and a leading contributor to global 
growth. Inflationary pressures are abating, led by 
steady core disinflation and deflation in fuel prices. 
Food inflation, however, remains vulnerable to 
recurring supply shocks which are preventing 
a quicker alignment of headline inflation with 
the target. Fiscal consolidation is progressing 
along with an improvement in the quality of 
fiscal spending and adjustment. The external 
sector is gaining strength, with the narrowing 
of the current account deficit (CAD) and foreign 
exchange reserves rising to an all-time high. The 
financial sector is sound and vibrant, supporting 
double digit credit growth, backed by high capital 
adequacy, solid earnings and improvements in 
asset quality. The outlook for the Indian economy 
in 2024-25 is brightening.
2. Assessment of the 2023-24 Experience
Global Economy
I.4 According to the International Monetary 
Fund (IMF)2, global growth decelerated to 3.2 
per cent during 2023 from 3.5 per cent during 
* :  Wherever information is available, this chapter has been updated beyond March 2024.
1 Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru are amongst EMEs that have cut their policy rates during 2024; Indonesia and Türkiye, on the 
other hand, have raised their policy rates during this period. 
2 World Economic Outlook, April 2024, International Monetary Fund (IMF).

ANNUAL REPORT 2023-2422022. The pace of economic activity was dragged 
down, inter alia, by restrictive monetary policy 
stances to tame inflation, protracted geopolitical 
tensions and sluggish recovery in China. The 
potential impact of climate change became 
increasingly evident, with economic losses due 
to extreme weather events. Global inflation fell to 
6.8 per cent in 2023 from 8.7 per cent in 2022 on 
the back of easing commodity prices, favourable 
supply conditions and monetary tightening across 
major economies, but still remained at its highest 
level in over two decades. Inflation in respect 
of core items and services remained elevated, 
exhibiting persistence in major economies  
amidst tight labour market conditions.
I.5 Global merchandise trade volume 
contracted by 1.2 per cent in 2023 in contrast 
to an increase of 3.0 per cent in the preceding 
year as demand rotated back from goods towards 
services with the ebbing of the pandemic3. Apart 
from geopolitical tensions and geoeconomic 
fragmentation, the multi-decadal high inflation in 
2023 depressed consumption of manufactured 
goods, which also dampened external trade. On 
the other hand, services trade exhibited resilience 
due to continued recovery in spending on travel 
from the COVID-19 pandemic lows and sustained 
demand for digitally delivered services.
I.6 Global financial conditions tightened 
amidst heightened volatility in response to 
synchronised monetary policy tightening as 
well as aggravating geopolitical conflicts. 
Sovereign bond yields hardened to multi-year 
highs in the first half of 2023-24, driven up by 
monetary tightening and exhibited large two-way fluctuations in the subsequent period over 
growing haziness surrounding monetary policy 
trajectories of major central banks. The US dollar 
remained strong, with large swings in response 
to changing monetary policy expectations. This 
exerted downward pressures on a number of 
EME currencies. Global equity markets inched 
up higher on prospects of soft landing, with 
sharp gains registered in technology and artificial 
intelligence (AI) related stocks.
Domestic Economy
I.7 Against the backdrop of subdued global 
economic activity and multiple headwinds, the 
Indian economy expanded at a robust pace in 
2023-24, with real GDP growth accelerating to 
7.6 per cent from 7.0 per cent in the previous 
year – the third successive year of 7 per cent or 
above growth4. With gross fixed capital formation 
(GFCF) accelerating to 10.2 per cent in 2023-24 
from 6.6 per cent in 2022-23, investment was 
the major driver of domestic demand, buoyed by 
government spending on infrastructure. Growth in 
private consumption demand, on the other hand, 
stood at 3.0 per cent as against 6.8 per cent a year 
ago. Government consumption demand was also 
subdued tracking fiscal consolidation. Net exports 
dragged down growth due to the moderation in 
exports as a result of contraction in global trade 
volumes. Import demand was relatively buoyant 
on robust domestic demand.
I.8 On the supply side, growth in gross value 
added (GVA) in the agriculture and allied sector 
in 2023-24 stood at 0.7 per cent as against 4.7 
per cent a year earlier as foodgrains production

National Statistical Office on February 29, 2024, unless indicated otherwise.

ASSESSMENT AND PROSPECTS3declined due to the deficient and uneven southwest 
monsoon rainfall. The government undertook a 
number of supply measures throughout the year 
to maintain domestic supply-demand balance in 
food items and mitigate inflationary pressures. 
They included release of public foodgrains stocks 
through open market sales; application of stock 
limits in cereals and pulses; export restrictions 
on cereals and onions; and easing of access to 
import pulses and edible oils. The declaration of 
2023 as the international year of millets by the 
United Nations (UN) provided a renewed thrust 
to diversification of crops from rice and wheat 
towards nutritional, environmentally sustainable 
and traditional crops across the country.
I.9 In the industrial sector, manufacturing 
GVA accelerated, benefitting from the boost to 
corporate profitability provided by easing of input 
costs. Industrial activity was also supported by 
the sustained momentum in mining and electricity 
generation. Infrastructure and capital goods 
production gained from the government’s push to 
capital expenditure. The production of consumer 
goods recovered, led by the consumer non-
durables segment. The recovery in consumer 
goods was volume driven, with growth in rural 
demand catching up with the urban segment. The 
government continued with initiatives to promote 
the industrial sector, especially in emerging 
areas. Investment amounting to ₹1.3 trillion was 
approved for the establishment of three semi-
conductor manufacturing units as part of the 
development of the full production line for semi-
conductors. In order to support the renewable 
energy initiative, royalty rates for the extraction 
of three vital and strategic minerals [viz., lithium, niobium, and rare earth elements (REEs)] were 
specified to attract bidders in the auction process. 
The government also endorsed a viability gap 
funding (VGF) scheme to develop battery 
energy storage systems (BESS) by lowering 
storage costs for both distribution companies 
and consumers. The ‘Pradhan Mantri Surya 
Ghar: Muft Bijli Yojana’   5 marks a significant push 
towards sustainable energy solutions.
I.10 The services sector, with a share of over 
63 per cent in GVA, remained the mainstay of 
aggregate supply, with growth of 7.9 per cent 
in 2023-24. Construction activity accelerated 
to register double digit growth, benefitting from 
rising demand in the housing sector and the 
government’s thrust on infrastructure.  The 
sustained ebullience in bank credit growth 
propelled financial services, while there was 
a slowdown in IT services during 2023-24 on 
subdued global demand.
I.11 Employment conditions improved, with 
the unemployment rate falling to its lowest level 
during 2023 (January-December) - 3.1 per cent 
in the usual status and 5.0 per cent in the current 
weekly status - in the periodic labour force survey 
(PLFS) series for which data are available from 
2017-18 (July-June). Both urban and rural regions 
recorded a decline in the unemployment rate.  
The labour force participation rate (LFPR) and 
worker population ratio (usual status) increased 
to 59.8 per cent and 58.0 per cent, respectively, 
in 2023, the highest since the survey’s inception, 
along with a steep rise in the female LFPR.
I.12 According to the Climate Change  
Performance Index (CCPI) Report 2024, India’s 
5 The scheme, launched on February 13, 2024, aims to provide free electricity to one crore households; the households will be provided a 
subsidy of up to 40 per cent of the cost of the solar panels to install it on their roofs.

ANNUAL REPORT 2023-244climate action performance improved, making 
India the fourth best performing nation among 63 
countries analysed. Strong progress was made 
towards nationally determined contributions 
in terms of key indicators like reduction in the 
emission intensity of GDP and an increase in the 
installed capacity of non-fossil fuel-based energy 
resources. Among major climate initiatives, India 
notified the carbon credit trading scheme (CCTS) 
while also launching the National Green Hydrogen 
Mission.
I.13 Inflationary pressures moderated albeit  
unevenly during 2023-24, reflecting the combined 
impact of calibrated monetary tightening, easing 
of input cost pressures and supply management 
measures. Headline inflation softened to 5.4 per 
cent during 2023-24 from 6.7 per cent in the 
previous year, driven by the fall in core inflation 
(CPI excluding food and fuel) to 4.3 per cent from 
6.1 per cent. Fuel inflation also eased sharply, 
moving into deflation since September 2023, with 
the reduction in the domestic prices of liquefied 
petroleum gas (LPG) and kerosene on the back of 
correction in global energy prices. Food inflation, 
on the other hand, hardened amidst high volatility. 
Sustained pressures from prices of cereals, 
pulses, spices and vegetables due to overlapping 
supply shocks pushed up food inflation to 7.0 per 
cent in 2023-24 from 6.7 per cent a year ago, 
thereby keeping headline inflation above the 
target.
I.14 Considering the growth-inflation 
dynamics, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) 
kept the policy repo rate unchanged at 6.50 per 
cent during 2023-24 and continued with a stance 
of withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that 
inflation progressively aligns with the target, while 
supporting growth. The MPC noted that monetary 
policy has to remain disinflationary to ensure fuller transmission and better anchoring of inflation 
expectations. Liquidity conditions tightened during 
2023-24 in sync with the monetary policy stance. 
The liquidity surplus as reflected in average daily 
net absorption under the liquidity adjustment 
facility (LAF) moderated to ₹485 crore during 
2023-24 from ₹1.87 lakh crore in the previous 
year. The Reserve Bank conducted two-way 
operations, both main and fine-tuning auctions, 
to ensure availability of adequate liquidity in the 
banking system. The weighted average call rate 
(WACR) traded, on an average, 13 basis points 
(bps) above the policy repo rate during 2023-24.
I.15 Domestic financial markets remained 
stable during 2023-24, with orderly movements 
in the bond and foreign exchange markets 
and exuberant equity markets. G-sec yields 
softened on favourable inflation prints, reports 
of inclusion of Indian bonds in major global 
bond indices and lower than expected market 
borrowings by the Union Government in the 
interim Union Budget 2024-25. Corporate bond 
yields moderated tracking the G-sec yields, and 
corporate bond issuances increased. The Indian 
Rupee (INR) displayed stability on the back of 
improving external sector and macroeconomic 
fundamentals, including a significant moderation 
in the CAD and resurgent capital inflows, 
that offset persistent headwinds from volatile 
global financial markets, the strong US dollar 
and persisting geopolitical tensions. The INR 
depreciated by 1.4 per cent during 2023-24 (7.8 
per cent in the previous year) and was amongst 
the best performing major EME currencies during 
the year. Equity prices recorded solid gains on 
robust corporate earnings and strong domestic 
GDP growth. There were, however, intermittent 
corrections due to geopolitical concerns and 
uncertain monetary policy trajectories in the 

ASSESSMENT AND PROSPECTS5systemic economies. The domestic equity market 
capitalisation crossed the US$ 4 trillion mark in 
H2:2023-24, making the Indian stock market the 
fifth largest in the world.
I.16 The transmission of the repo rate 
increases undertaken in 2022-23 to banks’ 
lending and deposit rates continued in 2023-
24 amidst moderation in surplus liquidity in the 
banking system and credit growth persistently 
outpacing deposit growth. The share of external 
benchmark linked loans in total outstanding 
floating loans rose further, with a concomitant fall 
in the marginal cost of funds-based lending rate 
(MCLR) linked loans. The expansion of currency 
in circulation moderated while deposit growth 
accelerated with the return of ₹2000 banknotes 
(following their withdrawal from circulation in May 
2023) to the banking system, mostly in the form 
of deposits.
I.17 The central government delivered on 
its fiscal consolidation commitments. The gross 
fiscal deficit (GFD) declined to 5.9 per cent of 
GDP in 2023-24 (RE) from 6.4 per cent of GDP 
in 2022-23. Revenue spending growth was 
contained at 2.5 per cent while capital expenditure 
grew in double digits for the fourth consecutive 
year. Fiscal adjustment was also supported by 
buoyant revenues - gross tax revenues increased 
to 11.7 per cent of GDP in 2023-24 (RE), their 
highest level since 2008-09, driven by income 
tax collections. States budgeted a GFD of 3.1 
per cent of GDP in 2023-24, within the limit of 
3.5 per cent prescribed by the Centre. Capital 
expenditure by states rose by 19.4 per cent 
during 2023-24. The general government deficit 
moved lower in 2023-24 (BE), even as general 
government capital outlay increased from 5.0 per 
cent of GDP in 2022-23 (RE) to 5.6 per cent of 
GDP in 2023-24 (BE).I.18 During H2:2023-24, the Reserve Bank 
issued an ultra-long security of 50-year tenor 
aggregating ₹30,000 crore to cater to the 
growing needs of long-term institutional players. 
The central government’s borrowing in H2 also 
included the issuance of new sovereign green 
bonds (SGrBs) of 30 years. The weighted average 
yield (WAY) on G-secs issued during the year 
moderated to 7.24 per cent in 2023-24 from 7.32 
per cent in the previous year.
I.19 India’s merchandise exports fell in 2023-
24, driven by the declines in global trade volume 
and commodity prices. In 2023-24, merchandise 
exports contracted by 3.1 per cent in US 
dollar terms, while imports fell by 5.7 per cent. 
Consequently, India’s merchandise trade deficit 
narrowed to US$ 238.3 billion during 2023-24 
from US$ 264.9 billion a year ago. With robust 
services exports and a steady flow of inward 
remittances, the CAD moderated to 1.2 per cent 
of GDP during April-December 2023 from 2.6 per 
cent in the corresponding period a year ago.
I.20 Capital flows were robust during 2023-
24, attracted by buoyant economic growth 
and improving domestic macroeconomic 
fundamentals. Net foreign portfolio investment 
(FPI) flows recorded a significant turnaround to 
US$ 41.6 billion in 2023-24, the second highest 
after 2014-15 (US$ 45.1 billion). India received 
the highest net FPI inflows amongst EME peers 
during the year. Gross foreign direct investment 
(FDI) flows were resilient at US$ 71.0 billion in 
2023-24, broadly comparable to US$ 71.4 billion 
a year ago. Net foreign direct investment (FDI) 
flows, however, moderated to US$ 10.6 billion 
from US$ 28.0 billion primarily owing to higher 
repatriation. Other major capital flows - external 
commercial borrowings (ECBs) and non-resident 
deposits - were higher during the year. With overall 

ANNUAL REPORT 2023-246net capital inflows outpacing the CAD, there was 
an accretion to the foreign exchange reserves 
to the tune of US$ 32.9 billion (on a balance of 
payments basis, i.e., excluding valuation effects) 
during April-December 2023. India’s foreign 
exchange reserves rose to an all-time high of 
US$ 648.7 billion as on May 17, 2024, covering 
11.4 months of imports and strengthening 
buffers against external sector risks and adverse 
spillovers.
I.21 Scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) 
remained well-capitalised, maintaining capital 
adequacy above the regulatory minimum as 
at end-September 2023. Bank credit growth 
sustained momentum during 2023-24. The asset 
quality of SCBs improved further, along with 
moderation in the gross non-performing assets 
(GNPAs) as at end-September 2023. Profitability 
indicators such as return on equity (RoE) and 
return on assets (RoA) were also robust. Macro 
stress tests for credit risk suggest that SCBs 
would be in a position to comply with the minimum 
capital requirements, both at the aggregate and 
individual bank level, even under a severe stress 
scenario.
I.22 Capital adequacy of non-banking financial 
companies (NBFCs) was comfortable and asset 
quality improved as at end-September 2023. 
On the profitability front, RoA and net interest 
margin (NIM) stood strong and the cost-to-
income ratio improved. Robust credit growth was 
sustained, supported by demand for retail credit. 
Urban cooperative banks (UCBs) witnessed an 
improvement in their capital adequacy, with their 
capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (CRAR) 
surpassing the minimum requirement across all 
tiers in September 2023.I.23 Several regulatory and supervisory 
guidelines were issued during the year in line 
with global best practices towards strengthening 
of governance, risk management practices and 
capital buffers. The regulatory guidelines included: 
(a) default loss guarantee in digital lending;  
(b) framework for compromise settlements and 
technical write-offs; (c) prudential norms for 
classification, valuation, operations of investment 
portfolios of commercial banks; (d) minimum 
capital requirements for operational risk; and  
(e) establishment of an umbrella organisation for 
UCBs. A draft disclosure framework on climate-
related financial risks was released in February 
2024 for public consultation.
I.24 On the supervision side, the Reserve 
Bank actively engaged with supervised entities 
(SEs) to ensure execution of best practices 
related to governance and assurance functions 
and compliance with the extant guidelines. The 
Reserve Bank undertook a comprehensive onsite 
cyber risk assessment of major SEs. The coverage 
of information technology (IT) examination was 
expanded to cover more UCBs and select NBFCs, 
with close follow up of compliance in identified risk 
areas. The implementation of DAKSH6, a SupTech 
tool, considerably streamlined the communication 
and dissemination of threat intelligence to SEs. 
The Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework, 
introduced on December 14, 2021 for NBFCs 
(except government NBFCs), has been extended 
to government NBFCs (except those in Base 
Layer) and it would be applicable with effect from 
October 1, 2024.
I.25 During 2023-24, the Reserve Bank 
conducted pilots with various use cases in central 
bank digital currency-Retail (e₹-R) as well as  
6 Reserve Bank’s advanced supervisory monitoring system.  

ASSESSMENT AND PROSPECTS7e₹-Wholesale (e₹-W) segments. The pilot in 
the e₹-R segment was expanded to 15 banks 
and covered 81 locations. The interoperability 
between the unified payments interface (UPI) and 
the CBDC was introduced to leverage the UPI 
acceptance infrastructure to offer convenience 
and a seamless experience to the users.  
The scope of the e₹-W was expanded to include 
interbank lending and borrowing transactions 
along with changes in technical architecture.
I.26 With the objective of bringing efficiency 
in terms of cost reduction, quicker disbursement, 
and scalability in all segments of loans where 
rule-based lending is possible, a public tech 
platform for frictionless credit (PTPFC) was 
conceptualised by the Reserve Bank and 
developed by the Reserve Bank Innovation Hub 
(RBIH), drawing upon the learnings from the 
pilot in digital kisan credit card (KCC) and digital 
dairy projects conducted in 2022. The pilot of 
the platform commenced on August 17, 2023 
and its scope and coverage are being expanded 
to include more products, data providers and 
lenders, based on learnings and feedback from 
stakeholders.
I.27 The rapid momentum of online retail and 
e-commerce, along with their growing adoption 
in tier 2 and tier 3 centres, drove the overall 
growth in card transactions. The Bharat Bill 
Payment System (BBPS) sustained momentum, 
facilitating bill collection and payments for more 
than 21,000 billers through an extensive network 
of 1,272 digital and around 92 lakh physical 
outlets nationwide. The account aggregator (AA) 
ecosystem, designed to facilitate secure and 
convenient data exchange for enhanced access 
to financial products and services, recorded 
considerable growth. The number of newly linked 
accounts and consent requests surged ten-fold during 2023-24. Concurrently, successful e-KYC 
authentications through Aadhaar grew by 28 
per cent, symbolising the digitalisation-driven 
metamorphosis of the financial sector.
I.28 In order to enhance customer experience 
with other payment modes, the Reserve Bank 
expanded the scope and reach of e-RUPI 
vouchers (purpose-specific digital vouchers), 
streamlined BBPS processes and membership 
criteria, and issued a circular mandating card 
issuers to provide the customers the facility to 
choose among multiple card networks for their 
card issuance. Significant progress was made 
in making available a variety of digital payment 
options as their usage increased. In 2023-24, 
total digital payments recorded growth of 44.3 
per cent and 16.4 per cent in volume and value 
terms, respectively, on top of growth of 58.3 
per cent and 19.7 per cent, respectively, in the 
previous year.
I.29 The UPI platform achieved significant 
milestones, surpassing 13 billion transactions 
in a single month in March 2024. The notable 
reduction in the time taken to add another 
billion to its tally, coupled with a decrease in 
the average ticket size, underscores the pivotal 
role played by UPI in facilitating retail payments. 
Enhancements in various payment systems to 
facilitate user access and convenience continued 
during the year. To expand the ease of payments 
in offline transactions, near field communication 
(NFC) technology in UPI-Lite was enabled. An 
innovative payment mode, viz., ‘Conversational 
Payments’ to initiate and complete transactions 
in a safe and secure environment, was also 
launched on the UPI. The entities facilitating 
cross-border payment transactions for import 
and export of goods and services were brought 
under the direct regulation of the Reserve Bank. 

ANNUAL REPORT 2023-248RuPay cards and UPI connectivity between India 
and Mauritius, and UPI connectivity between 
India and Sri Lanka were enabled. The scope of 
trade receivables discounting system (TReDS) 
was expanded by permitting insurance for 
transactions, expanding pool of financiers and 
enabling secondary market for factoring units 
(FUs).
I.30 The Reserve Bank’s Financial Inclusion 
Index (FI-Index), a measure to assess the extent 
of financial inclusion in the country, improved from 
56.4 in March 2022 to 60.1 in March 2023, with 
growth witnessed across the three sub-indices 
of access, usage and quality. Improvement in 
FI-Index was mainly contributed by usage and 
quality dimensions, reflecting deepening of 
financial inclusion. To assess and monitor the 
progress of financial inclusion and to gauge the 
extent of financial exclusion, a Financial Inclusion 
Dashboard - ANTARDRISHTI - was launched in 
June 2023.
I.31 The G20 Indian Presidency7 under the 
Finance Track accorded primacy to the broad 
themes of climate change, digitalisation, and 
concerns of the Global South with priorities 
cutting across various Working Groups. Realising 
the vision of ‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam’ - One 
Earth: One Family: One Future - the G20 Indian 
Presidency reaffirmed that the G20 remains the 
premier forum for global economic cooperation to 
steer the world through emerging challenges. The 
Indian Presidency revitalised multilateralism and 
amplified the Global South’s voice, particularly 
in the areas of development finance, debt 
vulnerabilities and financial inclusion.3. Prospects for 2024-25
Global Economy
I.32 The global economic outlook remains 
beset by multiple headwinds: inflation persisting 
above target with the pace of disinflation losing 
momentum; elevated public debt in major systemic 
economies and their repercussions on the global 
economy in the case of disorderly adjustments; 
financial stability risks from the higher for longer 
interest rates scenario; protracted geopolitical 
tensions; inefficiencies from geoeconomic 
fragmentation; and accentuated climate shocks. 
The global economy is projected to grow by 3.2 
per cent each in 2024 as well as in 2025, the 
same pace as in the preceding year8. Growth in 
the AEs at 1.7 per cent in 2024 is projected to be 
marginally higher than that of 1.6 per cent a year 
ago. Emerging market and developing economies 
(EMDEs) are projected to expand at 4.2 per cent, 
below 4.3 per cent a year ago.
I.33 Aided by restrictive monetary policy 
stances and lower international commodity prices, 
global inflation is projected to moderate from 6.8 
per cent in 2023 to 5.9 per cent in 2024 and 4.5 
per cent in 2025. The last mile of disinflation is, 
however, turning out to be challenging, as stated 
earlier. Recurrent supply shocks from adverse 
climate events and geopolitical hostilities pose 
upside risks to the disinflation process. Central 
banks in major AEs expect inflation to approach 
targets gradually and have accordingly indicated 
rate cuts beginning this year. Upward inflation 
surprises in the recent prints are, however, leading 
to a continuous repricing in market expectations 
and generating significant volatility in key financial

ASSESSMENT AND PROSPECTS9market segments - currency, bonds and equities. 
Elevated financial market volatility and swings in 
capital flows add to macroeconomic and financial 
stability challenges faced by EMDEs.
I.34 Global trade volume (goods and services) 
is expected to recover with a growth of 3.0 per cent 
in 2024 and 3.3 per cent in 2025 from 0.3 per cent 
in 2023, with easing inflation and the expected 
rebound in goods trade9. The expected pick up 
in global trade in 2024-2025 will, however, pale 
relative to the 4.9 per cent expansion achieved 
during 2000-19.
I.35 High levels of public debt in major AEs and 
EMEs and their explosive trajectories are raising 
concerns around the sustainability of public 
finances in these economies and run the risk of 
adding to the already heightened financial market 
volatility. Elevated public debt levels in systemic 
economies can lead to spikes in risk premia and 
sovereign bond yields in these markets, which can 
then spillover to other financial market segments. 
The resulting retrenchment in capital flows could 
hamper the already subdued global growth. 
These potential disruptive dynamics call for 
credible fiscal consolidation plans in the affected 
countries to ensure stable global macroeconomic 
and financial environment. In the medium to 
long-term, climate change, cyber security, crypto 
currency, FinTech, CBDC and tech disruptions 
through AI/machine learning (ML), also require 
coordinated policy efforts at the global level.
Domestic Economy
I.36 The outlook for the Indian economy  
remains bright, underpinned by a sustained 
strengthening of macroeconomic fundamentals, 
robust financial and corporate sectors and a resilient external sector. The government’s 
continued thrust on capex while pursuing fiscal 
consolidation, and consumer and business 
optimism augur well for investment and 
consumption demand.
I.37 The prospects for agriculture and rural 
activity appear favourable due to the ebbing El 
Nino and the expected above normal southwest 
monsoon. The extension of Pradhan Mantri Garib 
Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY) scheme for a 
period of five more years with effect from January 
1, 2024 will strengthen national food security. The 
government’s focus on AatmaNirbhar Oilseeds 
Abhiyan, the expansion of environmentally 
sustainable nano diammonium phosphate (DAP) 
in all agro-climatic zones and the promotion of bio-
economy through a new bio-manufacturing and 
bio-foundry scheme in the interim Union Budget 
2024-25 would also support the agriculture sector.
I.38 The traction in construction activity is likely 
to be sustained, supported by both residential and 
non-residential real estate demand. Emerging 
sectors like renewable energy and semi-
conductors are expected to make rapid advances 
on the back of the recent initiatives. The interim 
Union Budget 2024-25, with an allocation of  
₹6,903 crore for semi-conductor and display fabs, 
would contribute to making India a global hub for 
chip and electronics manufacturing. Investments 
under the production-linked incentive (PLI) 
scheme are likely to gain further momentum going 
forward. These factors are expected to create 
new employment opportunities, improve labour 
incomes and strengthen domestic demand. 
Taking into account these factors, real GDP 
growth for 2024-25 is projected at 7.0 per cent 
with risks evenly balanced.
9 World Economic Outlook, April 2024, IMF.

ANNUAL REPORT 2023-2410I.39 The passage of ‘The Anusandhan  
National Research Foundation Bill, 2023’, has 
paved the way for establishing the Anusandhan  
National Research Foundation (NRF), which 
would provide a boost to research and innovation 
in basic science, healthcare, and humanities. 
Furthermore, the National Quantum Mission 
(NQM), approved at a total cost of around ₹6,000 
crore (2023-24 to 2030-31), would scale up 
scientific and industrial research and development 
(R&D) and innovative ecosystem in quantum 
technology (QT). It would propel national priorities 
like Digital India, Make in India, Skill India and 
Stand-up India, Start-up India, Self-reliant India 
and sustainable development goals (SDGs). 
All these initiatives, along with government-
led investment in the infrastructure sector and 
increasing adoption of digital technologies, are 
likely to boost productivity and potential growth in 
the medium-term.
I.40 Headline inflation moderated by 1.3 
percentage points on an annual average basis 
to 5.4 per cent in 2023-24. The easing of supply 
chain pressures, broad-based softening in core 
inflation and early indications of an above normal 
southwest monsoon augur well for the inflation 
outlook in 2024-25. The increasing incidence of 
climate shocks, however, imparts considerable 
uncertainty to the food inflation and overall 
inflation outlook. Low reservoir levels, especially 
in the southern states and the outlook of above 
normal temperatures during the initial months 
of 2024-25 need close monitoring. The volatility 
in international crude oil prices, the persisting 
geopolitical tensions and elevated global financial 
market volatility also pose upward risk to the 
inflation trajectory. Taking into account these 
factors, CPI inflation for 2024-25 is projected at 
4.5 per cent with risks evenly balanced.I.41 As the path of disinflation needs to be 
sustained till inflation reaches the 4 per cent target 
on a durable basis, the MPC in its April 2024 
meeting, kept the policy repo rate unchanged 
at 6.50 per cent and noted that monetary policy 
must continue to be actively disinflationary to 
ensure anchoring of inflation expectations and 
fuller transmission. The MPC also decided to 
remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation 
to ensure that inflation progressively aligns 
to the target, while supporting growth. The 
Reserve Bank will remain nimble and flexible in 
its liquidity management through main and fine-
tuning operations, both repo and reverse repo. It 
will deploy an appropriate mix of instruments to 
modulate frictional as well as durable liquidity to 
ensure that money market interest rates evolve 
in an orderly manner so that financial stability is 
preserved.
I.42 The Union government’s impetus to 
growth-inducing capital spending is likely to 
be sustained in 2024-25 with more than half of 
borrowings directed towards financing of capital 
outlay. The central government extended the 
financial assistance scheme for states’ capital 
expenditure to 2024-25 with an outlay of ₹1.3 
lakh crore. The budgeted reduction in gross 
market borrowings from 5.3 per cent of GDP in 
2023-24 (RE) to 4.3 per cent of GDP in 2024-25 
(BE) will enhance the flow of funds to the private 
sector and support private investment. The 
fiscal outlook for states remains favourable, with 
adequate fiscal room to pursue increased capital 
expenditure.  The digitalisation of the tax system 
has enhanced tax collections, with the Centre’s 
direct tax revenues budgeted to reach 6.7 per cent 
of GDP in 2024-25, the highest in three decades.

ASSESSMENT AND PROSPECTS11I.43 India’s merchandise exports should 
benefit from the projected rebound in global trade, 
but with downside risks from ongoing geopolitical 
conflicts and geoeconomic fragmentation. The 
CAD is expected to remain manageable in 2024-
25 given the resilient services trade balance and 
large inward remittance receipts on the one hand, 
and stable capital flows, on the other. India’s 
share in world remittance receipts is estimated to 
increase to 15.2 per cent in 2024 from 11.1 per 
cent in 2019 according to the World Bank. On the 
financing side, the favourable outlook for domestic 
economic growth, easing of domestic inflation, 
and business-friendly policy reforms would be 
enabling factors in attracting foreign investment, 
both direct and portfolio. The inclusion of India’s 
sovereign bonds in major global bond indices 
ahead is also expected to support FPI flows. The 
opportunities in bilateral and multilateral trade 
agreements to facilitate greater participation in 
global value chains (GVCs), expanding reach 
to newer markets, and leveraging international 
trade in the Indian Rupee, would boost exports 
and FDI inflows, and strengthen external sector’s 
resilience.
I.44 Capital and asset quality of banks and 
NBFCs remain healthy, supporting the growth in 
bank credit and domestic activity. Pre-emptive 
regulatory measures aimed at curbing excessive 
consumer lending and bank lending to NBFCs, 
and investments in alternate investment funds 
(AIFs) are expected to contain the build-up of 
potential stress in balance sheets of financial 
intermediaries and contribute to financial stability. 
While domestic banks and NBFCs have exhibited resilience amidst global uncertainties, recent 
events underscore the importance of vigilant risk 
management. Considering the dynamic nature of 
the interest rate risk, banks may have to address 
both trading and banking book risks, especially 
in the light of moderating NIM. On the liabilities 
side, it is imperative to focus on diversification 
of deposit sources as reliance on bulk deposits 
heightens sensitivity to interest rate fluctuations. 
Additionally, climate-related financial risks and the 
consequent micro and macro-prudential concerns 
necessitate a robust framework to identify, 
assess and manage such risks. Accordingly, the 
Reserve Bank is striving to make its regulations 
more principle-based, activity-oriented and 
proportionate to the scale of systemic risk, rather 
than entity-oriented.
I.45 Several regulatory and supervisory 
measures will be undertaken in 2024-25 to further 
strengthen financial intermediaries. They would 
include: (a) a comprehensive review of the extant 
IRACP10 norms and the prudential framework 
for resolution of stressed assets across REs; (b) 
harmonised set of prudential guidelines for all REs 
undertaking project finance; (c) a comprehensive 
review of the extant regulatory instructions on 
interest rates on advances across REs; (d) move 
towards adopting a forward-looking expected 
credit loss (ECL) approach; (e) issuance of 
Securitisation of Stressed Assets Framework;  
and (f) efforts towards enhancing awareness, 
building capacity, and fostering collaboration 
among stakeholders to address effectively the 
multifaceted challenges of climate change for the 
financial system.
10 Income Recognition, Asset Classification and Provisioning.

ANNUAL REPORT 2023-2412I.46 The supervisory initiatives taken by the 
Reserve Bank are aimed at identifying risks 
and vulnerabilities early, increasing the focus on 
root cause of vulnerabilities, and harmonising 
the supervisory rigour across various segments 
of the financial system. Frequent and wider 
interactions with the SEs would remain a critical 
tool to enhance the effectiveness of supervisory 
intervention. Strengthening governance and 
assurance functions of the SEs would continue to 
be a priority for the Reserve Bank.
I.47 For UCBs, a revised supervisory action 
framework (SAF) under the nomenclature PCA 
framework is under consideration to further 
streamline and facilitate timely supervisory 
intervention to enable UCBs to initiate and 
implement remedial measures to restore their 
financial health. Recognising the importance of 
assurance functions in ensuring early identification 
of vulnerabilities and initiating corrective action, 
the harmonisation of guidelines on assurance 
functions applicable to SCBs, UCBs and NBFCs 
is being examined to further enhance their 
effectiveness.
I.48 The Reserve Bank would expand the 
scope of ongoing pilots in e₹-R and e₹-W in 2024-
25 by incorporating various use cases as well 
as new designs, technological considerations 
and more participants, besides launching a full-
scale public tech platform with more financial 
institutions/data service providers and product 
offerings.
I.49 For payment systems, the Reserve Bank 
would continue to chart the course laid down 
in the Payments Vision 2025 document.  The 
focus would be on consolidation of measures to 
enhance customer centricity, promote innovation 
and support expansion. Under the ‘integrity’ pillar, the central payments fraud information 
registry (CPFIR) is planned to be extended to 
local area banks (LAB), state cooperative banks, 
district cooperative banks, regional rural banks 
(RRBs) and non-scheduled UCBs for payment 
fraud reporting. A risk-based authentication 
mechanism, as an alternative to SMS-based 
one-time password (OTP) for additional factor 
of authentication (AFA), would be effectuated to 
address risks in payments. On the international 
front, the fast payment system (FPS) as well as 
multilateral inter-linkages would be explored in 
collaboration with group of countries like European 
Union (EU) and South Asian Association for 
Regional Cooperation (SAARC).
I.50 Digital payments would be shaped through 
the pillars of integrity, inclusion, innovation, 
institutionalisation and internationalisation. India 
is poised to actively contribute to the sharing of 
knowledge regarding Digital Public Infrastructures, 
facilitating the creation of similar frameworks in 
other emerging nations. Furthermore, forward-
looking initiatives such as the establishment of a 
cloud facility for the Indian financial sector and the 
creation of a FinTech repository are expected to 
enhance operational efficiency, reduce complexity 
and promote financial innovations.
I.51 The Reserve Bank would continue with its 
focus on ensuring availability of banking services 
to all sections of society across the country 
and strengthening the credit delivery system to 
cater to the needs of productive sectors of the 
economy, particularly agriculture, and micro and 
small enterprises. During 2024-25, the Reserve 
Bank would also review the priority sector lending 
guidelines and work towards formulation of the 
next iteration of the National Strategy for Financial 
Inclusion (NSFI) for the period 2025-30.

ASSESSMENT AND PROSPECTS13I.52 For ensuring public confidence in the 
financial system and to protect the interests of 
customers of REs, the Reserve Bank would 
focus on embedding AI and other related tools 
in complaint management system (CMS) to 
facilitate lodging of complaints with ease and 
ensure greater consistency in decision making 
process. The internal grievance redress (IGR) 
framework would be further strengthened to 
encourage banks to take proactive measures to 
improve customer service.
I.53 On April 1, 2024, the Reserve Bank 
commemorated the 90th year of its establishment. 
Over these nine decades, the Reserve 
Bank remained steadfast in discharging its 
responsibilities with integrity and professionalism 
towards developing an efficient and robust financial 
system by adopting global best practices in the 
areas of regulation, supervision and monetary 
policy, providing financial stability and resilience 
to the domestic economy. Going forward, the 
Reserve Bank would continue to endeavour to 
proactively take appropriate measures in the 
best interest of the economy to ensure a stable 
and strong financial system, while being mindful 
of risks stemming from the evolving technology, 
innovations, business practices and growing 
complexities in the financial sector11.               4. Conclusion
I.54 To sum up, the Indian economy is 
navigating the drag from an adverse global 
macroeconomic and financial environment. 
Real GDP growth is robust on the back of solid 
investment demand which is supported by healthy 
balance sheets of banks and corporates, the 
government’s focus on capital expenditure and 
prudent monetary, regulatory and fiscal policies. 
As headline inflation eases towards the target, it 
will spur consumption demand especially in rural 
areas. The external sector’s strength and buffers 
in the form of foreign exchange reserves will 
insulate domestic economic activity from global 
spillovers. Geopolitical tensions, geoeconomic 
fragmentation, global financial market volatility, 
international commodity price movements and 
erratic weather developments pose downside 
risks to the growth outlook and upside risks 
to the inflation outlook. The Indian economy 
would also have to navigate the medium-term 
challenges posed by rapid adoption of AI/ML 
technologies and recurrent climate shocks. 
Even so, it is well placed to step-up its growth 
trajectory over the next decade in an environment 
of macroeconomic and financial stability so as 
to achieve its developmental aspirations by 
reaping its demographic dividend and exploiting 
its competitive advantages that have placed it as 
the fastest growing major economy of the world.

ANNUAL REPORT 2023-2414ECONOMIC REVIEW II
II.1.1  The global economy turned out to be 
resilient in 2023 in spite of tightening financial 
conditions engendered by restrictive monetary 
policy stances, geopolitical tensions and 
geoeconomic fragmentation. Global GDP rose by 
3.2 per cent in 2023 (3.5 per cent a year ago1) 
supported by buoyancy in the US and major 
emerging market and developing economies 
(EMDEs). Global inflation eased to 6.8 per cent 
in 2023 from 8.7 per cent a year ago on the 
back of monetary tightening and restoration of 
supply chains. Pandemic-induced loosening in 
fiscal policy exerted upward pressures on the 
global public debt-GDP ratio in an environment 
of sluggish growth and elevated interest rates. 
Global merchandise trade volume contracted 
by 1.2 per cent in 2023 from an expansion of 
3.0 per cent in 20222, dragged down by rising 
trade restrictions and a rotation of demand 
away from goods to services. Global financial 
markets exhibited bouts of volatility in response 
to fluctuating perceptions on the monetary policy 
trajectory among market participants in spite of 
high for longer stances articulated by central banks. Sovereign bond yields hardened in the 
first half of 2023-24 and exhibited sizeable two-
way movements in the second half. The US dollar 
remained firm through the year, putting downward 
pressures on emerging market economy (EME) 
currencies. 
II.1.2  Amidst global uncertainty, the Indian 
economy exhibited resilience during 2023-24, 
with real GDP growth3 improving to 7.6 per cent 
from 7.0 per cent in 2022-23, supported by robust 
fixed investment. On the supply side, economic 
activity was supported by the improvement in 
the manufacturing sector’s profitability which 
benefitted from lower input prices as well as the 
sustained momentum in services activity, offsetting 
the slowdown in the agricultural sector. 
II.1.3  Headline inflation moderated during 
2023-24 into the tolerance band on the back of 
anti-inflationary monetary policy, active supply 
management measures, and corrections in global 
commodity prices. Core inflation exhibited a 
broad-based disinflation and has moved below 4 
per cent from December 2023. The Indian economy exhibited resilience during 2023-24, in the face of headwinds from protracted geopolitical 
tensions and volatile global financial markets. The combination of a sustained anti-inflationary monetary 
policy stance and proactive supply management measures resulted in headline inflation remaining largely 
within the tolerance band. Monetary and credit conditions evolved in line with the monetary policy stance. 
Within the commitment to fiscal consolidation, emphasis was laid on capital spending. External sector  
sustainability indicators improved during the year , insulating the economy from spillovers from adverse global 
macro-financial shocks.

ECONOMIC REVIEW15II.1.4  General government finances exhibited 
improvement in terms of key deficit and 
debt indicators as the commitment to fiscal 
consolidation took hold amidst a directing of public 
expenditure towards growth-supportive measures 
with greater focus on capex. Tax revenues were 
buoyant, supported by resilient economic activity 
and improving compliance. 
II.1.5  During the year, domestic financial 
markets evolved in an orderly manner. Money 
market rates hardened with the ebbing of liquidity 
surplus, partly due to an increase in government 
cash balances. Issuances of certificates of deposit 
(CDs) increased amidst sustained credit demand. 
After remaining range-bound during H1:2023-24, 
sovereign bond yields softened on lower domestic 
inflation, announcement of inclusion of Indian 
sovereign bonds in major global bond indices, 
and lower than expected market borrowings 
programme of Government of India (GoI) 
announced in the interim Union Budget 2024-25. 
Equity markets registered strong gains on buoyant 
economic activity and corporate performance. The 
Indian rupee (INR) exhibited stability, supported 
by robust domestic prospects and improvements 
in India’s external position. The moderation in the 
current account deficit (CAD) amidst large capital 
inflows enabled addition to foreign exchange 
reserves. 
II.1.6  Against this backdrop, the rest of the 
chapter is structured into six sections. An analysis 
of the real economy is presented in section 2, 
followed by a detailed analysis of inflation and 
its drivers in section 3. The developments in 
monetary aggregates and financial markets are 
presented in sections 4 and 5, respectively. The 
evolution of government finances (centre and 
states) is discussed in section 6, and external 
sector dynamics are covered in section 7. II.2 THE REAL ECONOMY
II.2.1 The Indian economy exhibited resilience 
during 2023-24, notwithstanding persistent 
headwinds from subdued external demand, 
protracted geopolitical tensions and volatile 
global financial markets. Real GDP growth 
was sustained at 7 per cent and above for the 
third successive year in 2023-24, supported by 
robust growth in fixed investment on the back of 
the government’s focus on capital expenditure. 
On the supply side, economic activity was lifted 
by the boost to the manufacturing sector’s 
profitability from the correction in input prices 
and sustained momentum in services activity, 
even as the agricultural sector activity exhibited 
a slowdown. 
II.2.2 An assessment of aggregate demand 
and its major components is etched out in sub-
section 2. The developments in aggregate 
supply conditions in terms of the performance of 
agriculture, industry and services are presented 
in sub-section 3. Employment and labour market 
dynamics are discussed in sub-section 4, with 
concluding observations in sub-section 5.
2. Aggregate Demand
II.2.3 Real GDP rose by 7.6 per cent in 2023-24 
as compared with 7.0 per cent growth in 2022-23, 
according to the second advance estimates (SAE) 
of the National Statistical Office (NSO) [Table 
II.2.1 and Appendix Table 1]. This acceleration 
was powered by solid expansion in investment 
demand, which more than offset the slowdown 
in private consumption demand and the drag 
from external demand (Appendix Table 2). Real  
GDP growth was robust at 8.2 per cent during 
2023-24 (April-December). The acceleration 
in momentum in Q2 sustained in Q3:2023-24  
(Chart II.2.1). 

ANNUAL REPORT 2023-2416Consumption
II.2.4 Private final consumption expenditure 
(PFCE) – the mainstay of domestic aggregate 
demand – slackened in 2023-24. Deficient and 
uneven south-west and north-east monsoon 
pulled down both kharif and rabi production. 
Two-wheeler sales, an indicator of rural demand, 
picked up in H2:2023-24. Demand for work under 
the Mahatma Gandhi  National Rural Employment 
Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) also tapered in H2, 
suggesting some recovery in rural demand. Urban 
demand was supported by improvement in labour 
market conditions, higher disposable incomes, 
tapering of retail inflation and double digit growth 
in retail credit. Domestic air passenger traffic, 
railway passenger traffic and passenger vehicle 
sales recorded robust growth. Both collection 
of goods and services tax (GST) and issuance 
of E-way bills registered steady expansion. 
Government final consumption expenditure 
(GFCE) displayed a modest expansion in 2023-24 
as the government remained committed towards 
its fiscal consolidation path (Chart II.2.2).Investment and Saving
II.2.5 The rate of gross domestic investment 
in the Indian economy, measured by the ratio of 
gross capital formation (GCF) to GDP at current 
prices, moderated marginally to 32.2 per cent Table II.2.1: Real GDP Growth

ECONOMIC REVIEW17in 2022-23 from 32.4 per cent in the preceding 
year. Available information for the constituents 
of the GCF for 2023-24 indicate an uptick in 
investment, led by the government’s sustained 
thrust on infrastructure, coupled with ebullience in 
the housing sector. The ratio of real gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) to GDP inched up to 
34.1 per cent in 2023-24 from 33.3 per cent in the 
previous year. Among the components of GFCF, 
the construction sector gathered traction as 
evident in robust growth in its proximate coincident 
indicators – steel consumption and cement 
production (Chart II.2.3). Capacity utilisation (CU) 
of the manufacturing sector has remained above 
its long-term average. It increased to 74.7 per cent 
in Q3:2023-24 from 74.0 per cent in the previous 
quarter4. The seasonally adjusted CU was 74.6 
per cent in Q3:2023-24.
II.2.6 Gross domestic saving as per cent to gross 
national disposable income (GNDI) moderated to 
29.7 per cent in 2022-23 from 30.8 per cent in the 
preceding year, due to drop in household financial 
saving (net) to 5.2 per cent of GNDI in 2022-23 
from 7.2 per cent in the previous year (Table 
II.2.2 and Appendix Table 3) as households drew

ANNUAL REPORT 2023-2418experienced a spike in household financial saving 
(net) to 11.6 per cent of GNDI during 2020-21, 
as pandemic-induced restrictions on mobility 
and spending curtailed consumption of contact-intensive services. As a result, the accumulated 
stock of excess financial savings6 rose to 4.1 
per cent of GDP by end-March 2021; with the 
ebbing of the pandemic and release of the pent-
up demand, the stock of excess financial savings 
moderated to 0.7 per cent of GDP as at end-
March 2023 (Chart II.2.4). 
II.2.7 The saving-investment gap widened during 
2022-23, driven by non-financial corporations, 
reflecting the revival in investment demand along 
with a moderation in the saving rate (Chart II.2.5). 
The drawdown by the general government sector 
reduced further on the back of continuing fiscal 
consolidation.

(Table II.2.3). The momentum remained strong in 
Q2 and Q3:2023-24 (Ch art II.2.6).Agriculture and Allied Activities
II.2.9 The agriculture and allied activities sector 
faced headwinds from the uneven and deficient 
south-west monsoon (SWM) rainfall coinciding 
with strengthening El Nino 7 conditions. The 
overall SWM rainfall in 2023 (June-September) 
was 6 per cent below long period average (LPA)8 
at the all-India level (Chart II.2.7a). The late onset 
of the SWM, along with temporal and spatial 
uneven precipitation, delayed the start of kharif 
sowing and a shortfall occurred in overall kharif 
sowing. The north-east monsoon (NEM) [October-
December] also ended with a rainfall deficit (9 per 
cent). The below-normal SWM and NEM rainfall 
depleted reservoir storage levels (Chart II.2.7b).
II.2.10  As per the SAE, the production of kharif  
and rabi foodgrains in 2023-24 was 1.3 per cent

Boosting Millet Production in India: Identifying the Supply Side Drivers
lower than those of major producers around the world 
(Chart 1d).
The plot level comprehensive cost of cultivation survey 
(CCCS) data for 2021-22 show a significant yield gap 
from the frontier11 farmers, implying considerable scope 
for improvement. Against this backdrop, results from a 
generalised linear model using the CCCS dataset for 
2021-22 show a significant dependence of the yield gap12 
for bajra on the rainfall position (Table 1).India accounts for almost 80 per cent of Asia’s and 20 
per cent of global millet production10. The acreage and 
production of millets have, however, stagnated over the 
years (Charts 1a and 1b), partly reflecting incentives 
for cultivation of fine cereals through MSP-backed 
procurement and a visible shift in consumer preferences 
towards fine cereals (Rao, 2021). Millets are typically 
grown under rainfed conditions with no/minimal irrigation 
(Chart 1c). The productivity of millets in India remains

11 The maximum achievable (potential) yield is the average yield of the most productive farm plots (top 10 per cent of the surveyed sample 
for each of the states). The yield gap is defined as the difference between potential and actual yield. 
12 The outcome variable (yield gap) is in percentage terms; therefore, values range from zero (no yield gap) to maximum of one or 100 per 
cent. Due to this nature of the outcome variable, a fractional logistic regression model was selected for the analysis following Papke and 
Wooldridge (1996). It is hypothesised that a greater input use is associated with a lower level of yield gap.(Contd.)Chart 1: Production of Major Cereals vis-à-vis Millets in India

the yield gap. Labour, fertiliser and machine usage are also 
negatively and significantly related to the yield gap. The 
adoption of hybrid seeds improves yields. Higher expected 
net returns (proxied by using lagged prices and prevailing 
cost) are also likely to encourage farmers to invest more in 
high-yielding inputs and thus reduce the yield gap. References:

Source:  Central Electricity Authority.II.2.14 The manufacturing sector gained from 
the production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme. As 
of December 2023, actual investments of ₹1.07 
lakh crore was realised, which has resulted in 
production/sales of ₹8.7 lakh crore, creation 
of over 7.0 lakh jobs directly and indirectly, and 
exports surpassing ₹3.4 lakh crore. Incentives 
totalling around ₹4,415 crore have been disbursed 
since the beginning of the scheme. Electronics 
and pharmaceuticals have been the major 
beneficiaries of the PLI scheme. 
II.2.15 The mining sector index recorded 7.5 per 
cent y-o-y growth in 2023-24, led by expansion 
in coal production. Renewable energy, which 
accounts for around 13 per cent of the overall 
power generation, recorded a healthy growth 
during 2023-24 (Chart II.2.11). India had a total 
renewable energy capacity of 190.6 gigawatts 
(GW) as on March 31, 2024. 
Services Sector 
II.2.16 The services sector growth in 2023-24  
was boosted by construction activity and financial, real estate and professional services. 
Proximate indicators of services sector such as 
air traffic, railway freight, automobile sales, steel 
consumption, GST E-way bills and foreign tourist 
arrivals recorded buoyant expansion (Table II.2.5).
II.2.17 India’s construction sector, currently 
ranking as the world’s third largest, posted 
strong growth in 2023-24. Steel consumption 
and cement production expanded by 11.9 per 
cent and 9.1 per cent, respectively, in 2023-24. 
Pent-up demand and robust consumer sentiment 
for home ownership seen since the pandemic, 
maintained momentum in 2023-24 (Chart II.2.12). 
The information technology (IT) sector remained 
muted in 2023-24, impeded by global headwinds. 
The hospitality sector made further gains, with 
sustained leisure and corporate travel demand. In 
the financial sector, aggregate deposits and bank 
credit to the commercial sector recorded double 
digit expansion. Public administration, defence, 
and other services (PADO) registered a steady 
growth. Per cen t

level in 2023-24 (Chart II.2.13).4. Employment
II.2.19 Labour market conditions improved 
during 2022-23 and 2023-24. According to the 
annual periodic labour force survey (PLFS), the 
unemployment rate (UR) declined further to 3.2 
14 SSCI is constructed by suitably extracting and combining the information collected from high frequency indicators, namely, steel 
consumption, cement production, cargo handled at major ports, sale/production of commercial vehicles, railway freight traffic, air passenger/
freight traffic, tourist arrivals, non-oil imports, bank credit and deposit.

ANNUAL REPORT 2023-2426per cent in 2022-23 (from 4.1 per cent in the 
previous year) alongside a rise in the labour force 
participation rate (LFPR) to 57.9 per cent from 55.2 
per cent15, with the progressive normalisation after 
the pandemic. LFPR and the worker population ratio (WPR) for 2022-23 were the highest since 
the inception of the PLFS series in 2017-18 (Chart 
II.2.14a). The employment situation improved in 
both rural and urban areas (Chart II.2.14b). 
II.2.20 As per the quarterly PLFS, which covers 
urban areas, the LFPR as well as the worker-
population ratio during Q4:2023-24 was the 
highest since the survey’s inception for persons 
aged 15 years and above, which pushed the 
unemployment rate to one of the lowest levels  
at 6.7 per cent (Chart II.2.15). The organised 
sector employment, as measured by payroll data, 
also indicated gains in 2023-24 (Chart II.2.16).
II.2.21 Productivity growth is a key driver of 
medium-term growth. The important factors 
contributing to productivity growth in India since 
the 1990s include resource reallocation from low-
productive to high-productive sectors and rapid 
penetration of information and communication 
technology (ICT)16 [Box II.2.2].
15 Annual indicators are based on usual status (principal status + subsidiary status) while quarterly PLFS indicators are based on current 
weekly status (CWS). All indicators are for age 15 years and above.

Productivity and Digitalisation in India
∆lnLp≡υ ̅ ictK ∆lnICTk+υ ̅ ictnonK  ∆lnICTnonk+υ ̅ L ΔlnLQ + ∆TFP .... (2)19
The decomposition results20 show that the contribution of 
ICT capital services to output growth increased from 5.0 
per cent during 1981-90 to 13.2 per cent during 1992-
2023. The contribution of ICT capital deepening to labour 
productivity growth increased from 8.4 per cent to 15.3 per 
cent over the same period.
Effect of ICT Sectors on TFP Growth
The 27 KLEMS industries have been segmented into ICT 
and non-ICT sectors to examine the productivity differential 
between ICT and non-ICT sectors using the following 
equation:The effect of digitalisation17 on productivity is assessed 
through two separate channels, viz., via the role of ICT as 
an input in driving output and labour productivity growth in 
the economy; and by estimating the productivity potentials 
by examining the differential between ICT and non-ICT 
sectors (Das and Erumban, 2016).
Role of ICT as an Input in Production Function
For India, estimates of productivity and output growth were 
constructed for 27 KLEMS industries from 1980 to 2020 
as follows:
∆lnY ≡ υ   ̅ ictK ∆lnICTk+υ  ̅ ictnonK  ∆lnICTnonk+υ  ̅ L ΔlnL+∆TFP .... (1)18
In the next stage, the decomposition of labour productivity 
growth is obtained as:
17 As per the OECD (2020), the extent of digitalisation can be measured by estimating the contribution of the ICT sector to economic growth.
18 Where the aggregate value added (Y) is obtained by summing industry value-added growth. ∆lnK and ∆lnL denote the growth in factor 
inputs - capital and labour. The capital input is segregated into ICT capital and non-ICT capital. They are denoted as ICTK and ICTnonK, 
respectively. υ   ̅ ictK  and υ ̅  ictnonK  denote the two-period average compensation share of ICT and non-ICT capital in aggregate value added. υ ̅  L  is 
the two-period average share of labour compensation in aggregate value added. ∆TFP represents aggregate TFP growth.
19 Where ∆lnLp represents labour productivity growth, ∆lnICTk  and ∆lnICTnonk represent growth in capital deepening in ICT and non-ICT 
industries, respectively, and ΔlnLQ  represents growth in labour quality.

ANNUAL REPORT 2023-24285. Conclusion
II.2.22 The domestic economy exhibited robust 
growth in 2023-24, underpinned by strong 
investment activity, amidst subdued external 
demand. Manufacturing and services sectors were 
the key drivers on the supply side while agricultural 
activity slowed down due to uneven and deficient 
monsoon rainfall. The growth outlook remains 
21 Where ∆Pit   is the annual productivity growth rate, i is the industry, and t is the year (1980-2020). ICT is the industry dummy, which takes 
the value 1, if the industry belongs to the ICT sector and 0 otherwise. Xit is a vector of control variables including labour quality, capital quality, 
total capital stock, industry fixed effects and year fixed effect. α is the estimated average productivity for the industry belonging to the non-ICT 
sector, and α + β is the estimated average productivity for the industry belonging to the ICT sector. Therefore, β shows the difference in the 
productivity growth rate of ICT and non-ICT industry.
22 The emergence of new digital technologies has coincided with a decline in productivity in many economies, a phenomenon often known 
as the ‘Solow Productivity Paradox’ (Van Ark 2016).Table 1: Productivity and ICT Sector

The results show that, on average, the ICT sector’s 
productivity fared better than the non-ICT sector for the 
whole sample period (1980-2020) and the decadal sub-
periods (Table 1). The productivity impact of ICT continued 
to grow during 1980 to 2010, refuting Solow’s productivity 
paradox for India22.
The emergence of the paradox in India for the more recent 
period (2010-2020), however, is generally consistent 
with the post-GFC productivity slowdown despite rising 
digitisation in many parts of the world, reflecting uneven 
access to digital technologies or their quality; and slow 
diffusion of technology benefits between the leading and 
the lagging firms (Dieppe et. al., 2020). References:

on capital expenditure while maintaining fiscal 
consolidation. Strong corporate balance sheets, 
rising capacity utilisation, double digit credit 
growth, healthy financial sector, and the ongoing 
disinflation are likely to be other growth levers. 
Lingering geopolitical tensions, geoeconomic 
fragmentation and adverse climate shocks impart 
downside risks to the outlook.

II.3.4	 Globally,	 inflation	eased	in	2023	from	its	
multi-decadal	 peak	in	2022,	but	it	ruled	above	
targets	and	pre-pandemic	 levels	across	major	
economies.	 Aggressive	 and	synchronised 	
monetary	 policy	tightening,	 normalisation	 of	
supply	chains	and	softening	 of	global	energy	
and	food	prices	helped	to	rein	in	inflationary 	
pressures.	 According	 to	the	International 	
Monetary	 Fund	(IMF),	global	inflation	fell	to	
6.8	per	cent	in	2023	from	8.7	per	cent	in	2022,	
although	it	remained	 above	the	average	of	3.5	
per	cent	during	2010-1925. 
II.3.5	 Amongst	 major	commodities,	 energy	
prices	decreased	 by	around	28	per	cent	during	
2023-24,	 according	 to	the	World	Bank	energy	
price	index	(Chart	II.3.2).	While	continuation	 of	
production	 cuts	by	OPEC+	countries	 exerted	
upside	pressures	 on	crude	oil	prices,	they	were	more	than	offset	by	subdued	global	demand	and	
increase	 in	non-OPEC+	 supply.	Metal	prices	
declined	by	around	8	per	cent	in	2023-24	on	 
weak	Chinese	 and	European	 demand.	
International	 food	prices	fell	by	10	per	cent	
due	to	improved	 supplies	from	robust	harvest.	
Rice	and	sugar	prices,	however,	 hardened	 on	
supply-demand	 gaps.	The	increasing	 incidence	
of	extreme	climate	events	and	lingering	global	
geopolitical	 uncertainties	 pose	risks	to	the	
inflation	outlook.

ANNUAL REPORT 2023-2432II.3.7	 Inflation	 in	food	and	beverages	 remained	
the	major	driver	of	headline	 inflation,	with	its	
contribution	 to	headline	inflation	increasing	 to	60.3	
per	cent	during	2023-24	from	46	per	cent	a	year	
ago.	Uneven	spatial	and	temporal	 distribution	
of	rainfall	and	extreme	weather	events	led	to	
crop	damages	 and	production	 shortfalls	 in	key	agricultural	 commodities.	 Frequent	 shocks	in	
vegetables	 prices,	combined	 with	lower	stocks	
of	wheat	and	decline	in	production	 of	pulses	and	
spices,	kept	food	inflation	at	an	elevated	level.	The	
impact	of	supply	shocks	on	state-level	 inflation	
could	provide	an	assessment	 of	their	spillovers	
across	state	borders	(Box	II.3.2).convergence,	 particularly	 for	core	inflation.	 While	the	
timeline	for	movement	 back	to	equilibrium	 remains	similar	
due	to	structural	 factors	and	policy	transmission	 lags,	the	
jump	in	core	inflation	is	notably	lower	than	in	the	pre-FIT	
period.	This	points	to	anchored	 inflation	expectations. 	
Thus,	credible	and	timely	monetary	 policy	actions	can	
contain	the	impact	of	shocks	on	inflation	both	in	terms	of	
size	and	duration. 	
26 The	absolute	rainfall	deviations	 capture	the	rainfall	status	relative	to	the	normal	rainfall.	High	deviations	 indicate	a	high	deficit	or	excess

positive	in	February	 2024	and	touched	41	per	
cent	in	March	2024	due	to	lower	production 	
in	2023-24	[(-)	1.9	per	cent	over	2022-23]	 and	
adverse	base	effects.	Vegetables	 such	as	ginger,	
garlic,	cauliflower,	 cabbage,	 brinjal	and	green	
chillies	also	witnessed	 high	price	pressures	 in	
July	due	to	rain-induced	 supply	disruptions.	 The	
unusually	 high	cumulative	 price	momentum	 in	non-TOP	vegetables	 contributed	 substantially 	
to	the	spike	in	vegetables	 inflation	during	July-
August	2023.	With	fresh	crop	arrivals,	the	prices	
of	these	vegetables	 corrected	 in	subsequent 	
months,	 albeit	lower	than	usual	due	to	higher	
minimum	 temperatures	 in	November-December 	
2023.
II.3.16	Inflation	 in	prices	of	cereals	and	products	
(weight	of	21	per	cent	in	the	CPI-Food	 and	
beverages)	 remained	 in	double	digits	during	
April-November	 2023,	driven	up	by	rice	and	
wheat	prices.	Wheat	prices	surged	on	the	back	
of	lower	production	 due	to	higher	temperature	 in	
February	 2023,	unseasonal	 rains	in	March	2023	
and	low	stock	levels.	Rice	prices	have	recorded	
double	digit	inflation	since	October	2022	on	
account	of	lower	 kharif	production	 during	2022-
23	as	well	as	lower	arrivals	in	2023-24.	In	order	
to	improve	domestic	 supply	and	to	contain	price	
pressures	 in	cereals,	the	government	 undertook 	
various	measures	 including	 allocation	 of	101.5	
LMT	of	wheat	and	25	LMT	of	rice	for	sale	under	
open	market	sale	scheme	(OMSS)	in	the	kharif  
marketing	 season	2023-24;	 imposition	 of	export	
duty	on	parboiled	 rice;	restriction	 on	exports	of	
non-basmati	 rice;	stock	limits	on	wheat;	launch	
of	retail	sale	of	‘Bharat’	brand	 atta	and	rice	at	
subsidised	 prices	to	increase	 supplies	in	the	
market	at	affordable	 rates;	and	restriction	 on	
diversion	 of	subsidised	 rice	to	distilleries	 for	
ethanol	production.	 Cereals	inflation	moderated 	
to	8.4	per	cent	in	March	2024,	with	wheat/atta  
inflation	at	4.7	per	cent.	Rice	inflation,	however,	
remained	 elevated	 at	12.7	per	cent.	The

II.3.17	Animal	 protein-rich	 items	such	as	eggs,	
meat	and	fish	(weight	of	8.8	per	cent	in	CPI-
food	and	beverages)	 witnessed	 uptick	in	prices	
during	May-June	 2023	due	to	heat	conditions 	
which	impacted	 egg	and	poultry	production	 in	
major	producing	 states	in	southern	India	(Chart	
II.3.8a).	Price	pressures	 moderated	 subsequently 	
due	to	fall	in	demand	on	account	of	Shravana 
period	during	July-August	 2023.	However,	 price	
pressures	 re-emerged,	 especially	 in	the	case	of	
eggs	from	September	 2023,	reflecting	 seasonal	
demand	and	higher	exports.	Milk	and	products	
price	inflation	moderated	 during	2023-24	 on	
favourable	 base	effects,	no	significant	 price	
hikes	by	major	milk	co-operatives,	 and	reduced	
peak	demand	for	milk	and	products	(such	as	ice-
cream,	curd	and	buttermilk)	 due	to	the	delayed	
onset	of	summer	following	 unseasonal	 rains	in	
the	early	part	of	2023	(March-May).	 Moreover, 	
easing	global	dairy	prices	discouraged	 exports,	
thereby	enabling	 higher	domestic	 supply	of	milk	fats	like	butter	and	 ghee.	Feed	and	fodder	
costs	moderated	 through	Q1:2023-24	 on	better	
domestic	 availability.	 Furthermore,	 as	the	dairy	
sector	recovered	 from	the	lumpy	skin	disease

cent	in	CPI-food	and	beverages)	 were	in	double	
digit	deflation	 throughout	 2023-24,	 averaging 	
at	(-)	14.8	per	cent,	due	to	higher	domestic

ECONOMIC REVIEW41II.3.24	Among	 the	major	constituents	 of	core	
CPI,	inflation	in	clothing	and	footwear	 eased,	
reflecting	 sharp	correction	 in	both	domestic	
and	international	 cotton	prices	and	muted	
export	demand	for	textiles	and	wearing	apparel.	
Household	 goods	and	services	inflation	witnessed 	
a	gradual	easing	to	2.7	per	cent	in	March	2024.	
Reflecting	 largely	unchanged	 domestic	petrol	and	
diesel	prices	since	August	2022	(Chart	II.3.14)	
and	moderation	 in	transport	 fares,	inflation	in	
transport	 and	communication	 prices	ebbed	to 
1.9	per	cent	in	2023-24	from	5.9	per	cent	a	
year	ago.	After	ruling	above	6	per	cent	during	
December	 2022-August	 2023,	inflation	in	the	
health	sub-group	 eased	gradually	 as	pandemic-
induced	healthcare	 services	demand	subsided	
and	medical	supplies	normalised.	 Around	75	per	
cent	of	the	core	CPI	items	registered	 less	than	
4	per	cent	inflation	in	March	2024,	indicating	 a	
broad	based	softening	(Chart	II.3.15).

in	April	2023	to	2.7	per	cent	in	March	2024.	Net	
of	housing,	 inflation	excluding	 food	and	fuel	
averaged	 4.4	per	cent	in	2023-24,	 significantly 	
lower	than	6.6	per	cent	a	year	ago.II.3.26	Inflation	 in	personal	 care	and	effects	
increased	 marginally	 to	7.8	per	cent	in	2023-24	
from	7.6	per	cent	a	year	ago,	primarily	driven	up	
by	higher	gold	prices	on	the	back	of	international 	
price	movements	 caused	by	war-induced	 safe-
haven demand.
5. Other Indicators of Inflation 
II.3.27	From	 a	sectoral	perspective,	 inflation	
measured	 by	the	CPI	for	industrial	workers	(CPI-
IW)	averaged	 5.3	per	cent	during	April-January 	
2023-24	as	compared	 with	6.1	per	cent	in	the	
corresponding	 period	a	year	ago.	Inflation	based	
on	the	CPI	for	agricultural	 labourers	 (CPI-AL)	
and	rural	labourers	 (CPI-RL)	 averaged	 higher	
at	7.0	per	cent	and	6.9	per	cent,	respectively, 	
during	April-February	 2023-24,	 primarily	driven	
by	elevated	food	inflation.
II.3.28	The	 wholesale	 price	index	(WPI)	remained	
in	deflation	during	April-October	 2023-24	before	
turning	marginally	 positive	thereafter,	 led	by	
sharp	increase	in	vegetables	 prices,	especially 	
onion	and	tomato,	in	November	 and	adverse	
base	effects	in	December.	 The	movement	 in	WPI

ANNUAL REPORT 2023-2442global	commodity	 prices,	particularly	 in	energy,	
food,	and	metals,	owing	to	normalisation	 of	
supply	and	slowdown	 in	global	demand.	Overall,	
WPI	inflation	averaged	 (-)	0.7	per	cent	during	
2023-24	(as	compared	 with	9.4	per	cent	a	year	
ago),	much	below	average	CPI	headline	inflation	
of	5.4	per	cent. 	
II.3.29	Low	 WPI	inflation	was	driven	by	all	the	
three	major	groups	–	primary	articles	(weight	
of	22.6	per	cent	in	WPI	basket);	fuel	and	power	
(13.2	per	cent);	and	manufactured	 products	
(64.2	per	cent).	Primary	articles	WPI	inflation	
moderated	 to	3.5	per	cent	during	2023-24,	 
mainly	reflecting	 deflation	 in	non-food	 articles	
and	crude	petroleum	 and	natural	gas,	in	line	
with	easing	global	prices	even	as	food	inflation	
fluctuated	 due	to	uneven	and	deficient	rainfall	
during	the	year.	In	contrast,	 fuel	and	power	
recorded	 deflation	 during	2023-24	 averaging 	
(-)	4.5	per	cent	(against	28.1	per	cent	inflation	
a	year	ago)	in	line	with	the	easing	of	global	
energy	prices.	The	broad-based	 moderation 	
in	global	commodity	 prices	kept	manufactured 	 
products	 prices	in	deflation	 during	2023-24	
averaging	 (-)	1.7	per	cent	(as	against	5.6	per	cent	
inflation	a	year	ago).	This	was	largely	on	account	
of	manufactured	 food	products,	 basic	metals,	
chemicals	 and	textiles.	Reflecting	 the	moderation 	
in	both	WPI	and	CPI	inflation,	the	gross	domestic	
product	(GDP)	deflator	inflation	moderated	 to	 
1.1	per	cent	in	2023-24	(April-December)	 from	 
8.2	per	cent	in	the	corresponding	 period	of	
2022-23.
II.3.30	Minimum	 support	prices	(MSPs)	in	2023-
24	were	increased	 in	the	range	of	5.3-10.4	per	cent	for	the	kharif crops and	2.0-7.1	per	cent	for	
the	rabi crops.	 Moong	witnessed	 the	maximum 	
MSP	increase	 among	 kharif crops, while	the	
increase	was	the	highest	for	lentils	(masur)	and	
wheat	among	rabi crops.	
II.3.31	Nominal	 rural	wage	growth	averaged	 6.0	
per	cent	in	April-February	 2023-24	as	compared 	
with	5.4	per	cent	in	the	corresponding	 period	
of	the	previous	year,	with	both	agricultural	 and	
non-agricultural	 wage	growth	near	6	per	cent.	
The	pace	of	growth,	however,	 has	moderated 	
since	October,	primarily	driven	by	deceleration 	
in	ploughing,	 horticulture	 and	packaging	 within	
the	category	of	agricultural	 labourers,	 and	beedi	
makers	and	bamboo/cane	 basket	weavers	within	
the	category	of	non-agricultural	labourers.
6. Conclusion
II.3.32	In	 sum,	headline	CPI	inflation	moderated 	
in	2023-24	 despite	overlapping	 food	price	
shocks.	The	softening	 was	the	outcome	of	the	
sustained	 anti-inflationary	 monetary	 policy	
stance,	proactive	 supply	management	 measures 	
by	the	government	 and	correction	 in	global	
commodity	 prices.	Core	inflation	exhibited	 a	
broad-based	 disinflation	 since	June	2023	and	
moved	below	4	per	cent	by	end-2023.	 While	
headline	inflation	dipped	into	the	tolerance	 band	
in	2023-24	 (barring	July-August),	 it	hovered	
above	the	inflation	target.	Lingering	 geopolitical 	
uncertainties,	 renewed	 supply	chain	pressures 	
due	to	geopolitical	 developments	 in	the	Middle	
East,	lower	reservoir	levels,	and	fall	in	production 	
of	major	crops	pose	upside	risks	to	headline	
inflation	going	forward. 	

ECONOMIC REVIEW43II.4 MONEY AND CREDIT
II.4.1 Monetary and credit conditions evolved 
in line with the monetary policy stance during 
the year, supporting domestic economic activity. 
Important factors impacting their evolution during 
2023-24 were the withdrawal of ₹2000 banknotes 
(May 2023), the merger of a non-bank with a 
bank (July 2023) and the temporary imposition 
of the incremental cash reserve ratio (I-CRR)31 
[August 2023]. The expansion in reserve money 
and currency in circulation moderated due to the 
return of a predominant part of ₹2000 banknotes 
to the banking system as deposits. The return of 
these banknotes, along with an increase in term 
deposit rates, contributed to an acceleration in 
aggregate deposits and broad money (M3). Bank 
credit exhibited sustained double digit growth in 
2023-24. Banks mobilised additional resources 
through certificates of deposit (CDs) to bridge the 
credit-deposit gap.
II.4.2 Against this backdrop, sub-section 2 
delves into reserve money dynamics and the 
shifts in the Reserve Bank’s balance sheet. 
Sub-sections 3 and 4 examine developments 
in money supply and bank credit, respectively, 
followed by concluding observations.
2. Reserve Money 32
II.4.3 Reserve money (RM) depicts the stock of 
monetary liabilities in the central bank’s balance 
sheet (Chart II.4.1). Risk buffers and revaluation 
accounts [forming the bulk of net non-monetary liabilities (NNML)] along with surplus liquidity 
placed by banks with the Reserve Bank under 
reverse repos/standing deposit facility (SDF) 
are the other major components of the balance 
sheet.
II.4.4 The Reserve Bank’s balance sheet size 
increased to 24.1 per cent of GDP at end-March 
2024 from 23.5 per cent at end-March 2023. 
The balance sheet has normalised to its pre-
pandemic level (Chart II.4.2).
II.4.5 The growth in RM33 decelerated to 6.7 
per cent in 2023-24 from 9.7 per cent a year ago 
(7.4 per cent when adjusted for the first-round 
impact of change in CRR34), below its decennial 
average35 of 12.9 per cent (2013-14 to 2023-24). 
This reflected largely the impact of withdrawal of 
31 See Chapter III for details on I-CRR.
32 In sub-section 2, growth and other ratios pertain to the last Friday of the respective financial year/quarter/month.
33 Comprises currency in circulation, bankers’ deposits with the Reserve Bank and other deposits with the Reserve Bank, on the liabilities side.
34 CRR was increased from 4.0 per cent to 4.5 per cent in May 2022.
35 Excluding the year of demonetisation 2016-17.NNML: Net non-monetary liabilities comprise economic capital (such as 
capital, reserves, contingency fund, asset development fund, currency 
and gold revaluation account, investment revaluation account and foreign 
exchange forward contracts valuation account), RBI employee provident 
fund account and IMF quota subscriptions and other payments minus 
other assets.

imposition of I-CRR during August-October 
2023 (Chart II.4.3b). The growth in currency in 
circulation (CiC) - the major constituent of RM 
with a share of 75.1 per cent – decelerated to 4.1 
per cent during 2023-24 from 7.8 per cent a year 
ago, due to the withdrawal of ₹2000 banknotes 
(Charts II.4.3a and II.4.3c).
II.4.6 The currency-GDP ratio has moderated 
with the ebbing of pandemic uncertainty and the 
increasing usage of digital payments37. India’s 
central bank digital currency (CBDC) is gradually 
gaining traction in the retail segment (Chart 
II.4.4). 
36 The total value of ₹2000 banknotes in circulation was ₹3.56 lakh crore as on May 19, 2023. As on March 29, 2024, 97.69 per cent of these 
banknotes have been returned to the banking system, with a bulk of these in the form of deposits.

ECONOMIC REVIEW45II.4.7 Bankers’ deposits with the Reserve 
Bank (22.9 per cent share in RM), i.e., balances 
maintained by banks to meet their CRR 
requirements, increased by 15.4 per cent in 
2023-24, in tandem with the expansion in bank 
deposits, as compared with 15.9 per cent in the 
previous year (Chart II.4.3a).
II.4.8 On the sources side (assets), RM 
comprises net domestic assets (NDA)38 and net 
foreign assets (NFA)39 of the Reserve Bank. 
During 2023-24, the expansion in RM was 
driven mainly by NFA, with net purchases from authorised dealers at ₹3.4 lakh crore as against 
net sales of ₹2.2 lakh crore in the previous year. 
NDA declined during the year as the increase 
in government cash balances pulled down the 
Reserve Bank’s net claims on the government, 
more than offsetting the expansion in net credit to 
banks and the commercial sector (Chart II.4.5).

ANNUAL REPORT 2023-2446components side (liabilities). M3 recorded a 
growth of 11.2 per cent as on March 22, 2024 
(9.0 per cent a year ago) driven mainly by time 
deposits, which benefitted, inter alia, from higher 
deposit rates with the transmission of policy rate 
increases (Chart II.4.6). The sustained demand 
for bank credit also exerted pressure on banks 
to mobilise more deposits. The expansion in  
bank deposits outpaced that in CwP for the 
second successive year41. The ratio of M3 to GDP 
has reverted to its pre-pandemic levels (Chart 
II.4.7).II.4.10 On the sources side (assets), the 
expansion in M3 was mainly driven by bank 
credit to the commercial sector, which grew by 
15.6 per cent in 2023-24 (14.4 per cent a year 
ago). The pace of expansion in net bank credit 
to the government decelerated to 5.7 per cent 
in 2023-24 from 11.5 per cent a year ago. The 
excess holdings of statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) 
securities42 of SCBs were 10.4 per cent of net 
demand and time liabilities (NDTL) as on March 
22, 2024 as compared with 11.0 per cent a year 
ago. The net foreign assets of the banking sector 
41 Demand deposits remained volatile, largely mirroring the variations in currency with the public.
42 Excess holdings of SLR securities provide collateral buffers to banks for availing funds under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) and 
are also a component of the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR). The Reserve Bank increased the limit for holding securities under held to maturity 
(HTM) category from 22 per cent to 23 per cent of NDTL, effective April 8, 2022. The HTM limits would be restored to 19.5 per cent in a 
phased manner by March 31, 2025, starting from the quarter ending June 30, 2024.Chart II.4.5: Reserve Money - Sources (Assets)

nominal GDP divided by M3, has remained stable. As on March 22, 2024, the money multiplier (MM) 
was 5.4, marginally higher than its decennial

4. Credit
II.4.12 Double digit growth in bank credit was 
sustained during 2023-24, led by demand 
from retail and services sectors. SCBs’  
credit expanded by 16.3 per cent as on March 
22, 2024 on top of 15.0 per cent a year ago 
(Chart II.4.10a). Bank group-wise, private sector 
banks (PVBs) continued to exhibit higher growth system as deposits. Adjusted for reverse repo 
- analytically akin to banks’ deposits with the 
central bank - the money multiplier turned out to 
be marginally lower at 5.3 as on March 22, 2024, 
with MM and adjusted MM converging (Chart 
II.4.9a). The reserve-deposit ratio remained stable 
due to no change in the CRR (Chart II.4.9b).

accelerated to 19.2 per cent (y-o-y) as on March 
22, 2024 from 17.8 per cent a year ago and that 
of PSBs to 14.7 per cent from 13.8 per cent. This 
resulted in a fall in PSBs’ share in total credit, 
although they still have the larger share (Chart 
II.4.10b).
II.4.13 Sector-wise44, credit to agriculture 
expanded by 20.1 per cent in March 2024 (15.4 
per cent a year ago). Credit growth to large 
industries was relatively muted (6.4 per cent), 
partly due to their improved profitability and cash 
flows. The increase in credit to micro, small and 
medium enterprises (MSMEs) was robust at 14.1 
per cent, supported by the availability of collateral-
free loans45. Services sector bank credit rose by 
20.2 per cent in March 2024, driven by demand 
from non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) 
and trade. However, the pace of expansion of bank credit to NBFCs moderated following 
regulatory measures announced by the Reserve 
Bank on November 16, 2023 (see Chapter VI). 
Personal loan growth remained solid at 17.7 per 
cent in March 2024, supported by housing loans, 
which account for about half of the segment 
(Chart II.4.11 and Table II.4.2).
II.4.14 SCBs’ deposit growth remained below 
that of bank credit during 2023-24 (Charts II.4.12a 
and II.4.12b). As a result, the incremental credit-
deposit ratio rose above 100 per cent during 
June 2022-May 2023 (Chart II.4.12c). This ratio 
fell subsequently on the back of an acceleration 
in deposit growth, but the wedge between 
credit and deposit growth has persisted. Banks  
bridged this funding gap through issuances of 
CDs which increased to ₹8.3 lakh crore during 
2023-24 from ₹6.4 lakh crore during the previous 
year (Chart II.4.12d).
44 Non-food credit data are based on fortnightly Section 42 return and covers all SCBs. Sectoral non-food credit data are based on  
sector-wise and industry-wise bank credit (SIBC) return, which covers select banks accounting for about 95 per cent of total non-food credit 
extended by all SCBs. Data pertain to the last reporting Friday of the month.
45 In Union Budget 2023-24, the government announced the revamping of credit guarantee scheme for micro and small enterprises with 
effect from April 1, 2023, with an infusion of ₹9,000 crore to the corpus to enable additional collateral-free guaranteed credit of ₹2 lakh crore 
and the reduction in the cost of the credit by about 1 per cent. Besides, the limit on ceiling for guarantees has been enhanced from ₹2 crore 
to ₹5 crore.Chart II.4.10: Bank Group-wise Credit

and quarter- and firm-fixed effects. Policy rate changes 
have a lagged impact on debt servicing indicators and 
the peak impact on the firms occurs 7-9 quarters after the 
policy rate action (Chart 1).
Corporate sector health - captured in indicators such  
as debt maturity structure and cash balances - could 
potentially amplify or soften the impact of policy rate 
actions on debt servicing costs. The Indian corporate 
sector has seen an elongation of the maturity structure 
of its debt along with a build-up of liquidity buffers. This 
imparts resilience to firms in the face of tighter financial 
conditions (Chart 2). Financial conditions driven by monetary policy cycles 
can impact funding costs, debt servicing capacity and the 
overall financial health of the non-financial corporate sector 
(Schularick et. al., 2021; Boissay et. al., 2023). Using CMIE

ANNUAL REPORT 2023-24525. Conclusion
II.4.16  The withdrawal of ₹2000 banknotes 
during the year and their return as bank deposits 
led to a deceleration in currency in circulation 
as well as reserve money while simultaneously 
contributing to an acceleration in deposit growth. 
Bank deposits were also boosted by attractive returns. Robust expansion in bank credit was 
sustained, led by services, agriculture, retail and 
MSME sectors. Upbeat consumer and business 
optimism and strengthening of banks’ balance 
sheets are expected to sustain credit growth 
necessitating a step-up in deposit mobilisation 
efforts to fund credit needs.References:

ECONOMIC REVIEW53II.5 FINANCIAL MARKETS
II.5.1	 Global	 financial	markets	remained	 volatile	
during	2023-24,	 reflecting	 uncertainty	 about	the	
pace	of	disinflation	 in	major	economies,	 and	the	
consequent	 monetary	 policy	trajectory	 of	major	
central	banks	as	well	as	intensifying	 geopolitical 	
tensions.	 Market	exuberance	 on	expectations 	
that	interest	rates	have	peaked	remained	 highly	
sensitive	to	forward	guidance	 and	incoming	data,	
leading	to	large	two-way	movements. 	
II.5.2	 Domestic	 financial	markets	evolved	in	an	
orderly	manner	during	2023-24	drawing	strength	
from	resilient	economic	 activity	and	strengthening 	
macroeconomic	 fundamentals.	 Money	market	
rates	firmed	up	in	H2:2023-24	 as	liquidity	surplus	
ebbed	due	to	a	sustained	 increase	in	government 	
cash	balances.	 Issuances	 of	certificates	 of	deposit	
(CDs)	rose	amidst	tight	liquidity	conditions	 and	
sustained	 credit	demand.	Sovereign	 bond	yields	
remained	 range-bound	 during	H1:2023-24	 but	
softened	thereafter	 on	lower	crude	oil	prices,	fall	
in	global	bond	yields,	announcement	 of	inclusion	
of	Indian	sovereign	 bonds	in	major	global	bond	
indices,	easing	of	domestic	 inflation	and	lower-
than-expected	 central	government	 borrowing	 for	
2024-25.	Corporate	 bond	yields	generally	tracked	
G-sec	yields	with	a	widening	 in	spreads	in	the	
later	part	of	the	year.	Equity	markets	registered 	
strong	gains	on	buoyant	economic	 activity	and	
corporate	 performance.	 The	Indian	rupee	(INR)	
displayed	 stability	on	the	back	of	improving 	
domestic	 growth	prospects	 and	higher	foreign	
portfolio	investment	(FPI)	flows. 	
II.5.3	 Against	 this	backdrop,	 money	market	
developments	 are	detailed	in	sub-section	 2.	Market	segments	 for	government	 securities	
(G-secs)	and	corporate	 bonds	are	discussed	 in	
sub-sections	 3	and	4,	respectively.	 Equity	and	
foreign	exchange	 market	developments	 are	
covered	in	sub-sections	 5	and	6,	with	concluding 	
observations	in	sub-section	7.
2. Money Market
II.5.4	 Money	 market	rates	oscillated	 around	
the	policy	corridor	during	2023-24	in	tune	with	
evolving	 liquidity	conditions46.	The	weighted	
average	call	rate	(WACR)	was	range	bound	in	the	
first	half	of	the	year.	It	hovered	close	to	the	ceiling	
of	the	liquidity	adjustment	 facility	(LAF)	corridor	
during	October-January	 on	tightening	 liquidity	
conditions	 resulting	 from	a	persistent	 build-up	
in	government	 cash	balances	 and	the	festival-
related	expansion	 in	currency	in	circulation	 (CiC)	
[see	Chapter	III].	The	WACR	eased	and	moved	
around	the	policy	repo	rate	during	February-
March.	The	average	spread	of	the	WACR	relative	
to	the	policy	rate	was	(+)13	basis	points	(bps)	in	
2023-24	as	compared	 with	(-)12	bps	in	2022-23	
(Chart	II.5.1). 	
II.5.5	 Volatility	 in	the	call	money	segment,	
measured	 by	coefficient	 of	variation47	of	the	
WACR,	decreased	 sharply	to	2.5	per	cent	in	
2023-24	from	18.1	per	cent	in	the	previous	year.	
Average	 daily	volume	in	the	money	market48 
declined	by	6	per	cent	to	₹5.04	lakh	crore	during	
2023-24	from	₹5.36	lakh	crore	in	the	previous	
year.	Intra-year,	 average	daily	volumes	initially	
fell	to	₹4.9	lakh	crore	in	Q2:2023-24	 from	₹5.0	
lakh	crore	in	Q1,	before	recovering	 to	₹5.1	lakh	
crore	in	Q3	and	further	to	₹5.2	lakh	crore	in	Q4	
46 Liquidity	management	operations 	by	the	Reserve	Bank	are	covered	in 	Chapter	III	of	this	Report.
47 Coefficient	of	variation	is	ratio	of	standard	deviation	to	the	mean.

ANNUAL REPORT 2023-2454amidst	tightening	 liquidity	conditions49.	Of	the	
total	money	market	volume,	the	share	of	triparty	
repo	increased	 from	61	per	cent	in	Q1:2023-24 	
to	67	per	cent	in	Q4	with	a	concomitant	 fall	in	the	
share	of	market	repo	from	37	per	cent	to	31	per	
cent.	The	share	of	uncollateralised	 call	money	
segment	remained	 at	around	2	per	cent	across	
quarters	(Chart	II.5.2).
II.5.6	 The	average	daily	spread	of	certificates	of	
deposit	(CD)	and	commercial	 paper	(CP)	rates	over	
T-bill	rates	picked	up	during	the	year	(Chart	II.5.3).	
Regulatory	 measures	 on	consumer	 credit	and	
bank	credit	to	non-banking	 financial	companies	
(NBFCs)	 announced	 by	the	Reserve	Bank	on	
November	 16,	2023	also	contributed	 to	hardening	
of	CP	rates	for	NBFCs	during	Q3:2023-24.
II.5.7	 In	 the	primary	market,	fresh	issuance	 of	
CDs	rose	from	₹1.5	lakh	crore	in	Q1:2023-24	 and	
₹1.6	lakh	crore	in	Q2	to	₹2.6	lakh	crore	in	Q3	
as	banks	sought	to	fund	robust	credit	offtake.	In	Q4,	the	CD	issuance	 was	₹3.0	lakh	crore.	New	
issuance	of	CPs	in	the	primary	market,	however,	
fell	from	₹3.8	lakh	crore	in	Q1	to	₹3.3	lakh	crore	
in	Q2,	and	₹2.9	lakh	crore	in	Q3,	amidst	tight	
liquidity	conditions	 and	increased	 appetite	for	
bank	loans.	However,	 in	Q4,	the	CP	issuance	
increased	again	to	₹3.8	lakh	crore.
3. G-sec Market 
II.5.8	 G-sec	 yields	 exhibited	 two-way	
movements	 in	2023-24.	 During	Q1,	yields	
traded	lower	in	response	 to	the	monetary	
policy	committee’s	 (MPC)	decision	to	keep	the	
policy	repo	rate	unchanged,	 favourable	 inflation	
readings	and	softening	 crude	oil	prices.	The	10-
year	generic	G-sec	yield	closed	the	quarter	at	
7.12	per	cent,	a	decline	of	19	bps	from	its	level	
on	March	31,	2023	(Chart	II.5.4).	The	yield	curve	
flattened,	 with	the	spread	between	5-year	and	10-
year	rates	narrowing	 to	4	bps	from	14	bps	as	at	
49 In	the	call	money	segment,	average	daily	volumes	(excluding	 saturdays)	 decreased	 from	₹11,274	crore	in	Q1	to	₹10,381	crore	in	Q2	before	
recovering	to	₹11,441	crore	in	Q3	and	₹11,785	crore	in	Q4.Chart II.5.2: Share of Major Segments in Money

ECONOMIC REVIEW55end-March	 2023.	During	Q2:2023-24,	 domestic	
G-sec	yields	increased	 in	sync	with	hardening 	
global	yields,	rising	crude	oil	prices	and	an	uptick	
in	domestic	inflation,	offsetting	 optimism	from	the	
inclusion	of	Indian	G-secs	in	major	global	bond	
indices50.	Domestic	 10-year	and	5-year	generic	
G-sec	yields	closed	the	quarter	higher	by	10	bps	
and	15	bps,	respectively,	 over	their	levels	in	the	
previous	quarter.	The	domestic	G-sec	yield	curve	
flattened	further	and	the	spread	between	5-year	
and	10-year	G-sec	yields	inverted	marginally	 to	1	
basis	point.
II.5.9	 During	 Q3,	10-year	generic	G-sec	yield	
moderated	 by	5	bps	to	7.17	per	cent,	reflecting	
softening	 in	global	yields	from	their	multi-year 	
highs	and	a	fall	in	Brent	crude	oil	prices	despite	
an	uptick	in	domestic	 inflation.	The	yield	curve	
steepened,	 with	a	sharper	fall	in	yields	for	short-end	tenor	 vis-à-vis	at	the	long-end.	 The	5-year	
generic	G-sec	yield	closed	10	bps	lower	at	7.13	
per	cent.	Yields	softened	further	during	Q4:2023-
24	amid	lower-than-expected	 gross	as	well	as	net	
market	borrowings	 in	the	Interim	Union	Budget	
2024-25	and	cooling	of	domestic	 inflation.	The	
10-year	and	5-year	generic	G-sec	yields	eased	
by	11	bps	and	7	bps,	respectively,	 during	the	
quarter,	with	both	at	7.06	per	cent	at	end-March 	
2024.

the	general	route	with	investment	 limits	set	under	
the	medium-term	 framework	 (MTF);	the	voluntary	
retention	route	(VRR);	and	FAR	(Table	II.5.1).	In

ANNUAL REPORT 2023-24564. Corporate Debt Market 
II.5.11	Corporate	 bond	yields	generally	 softened	
during	2023-24,	 mirroring	 G-sec	yields.	The	
monthly	average	 yield	on	AAA-rated	 3-year	
bonds	of	public	sector	undertakings	 (PSUs),	
financial	institutions	 (FIs)	and	banks;	NBFCs;	and	
corporates	 softened	by	12	bps,	14	bps	and	12	
bps,	respectively,	 in	March	2024	 vis-à-vis	March	
2023	levels	(Table	II.5.2).	The	yields	softened	
during	H1	and	generally	 hardened	 during	H2	with	
a	widening	of	spreads	amid	tightening	 of	liquidity	
conditions	 and	announcement	 of	regulatory 	
measures	 towards	consumer	 credit	and	bank	
credit	to	NBFCs.
II.5.12	The	 spread	of	AAA-rated	 3-year	bond	
yields	over	G-sec	yields	of	corresponding	 maturity	increased	 between	March	2023	and	March	2024.	
The	average	daily	secondary	 market	turnover	in	
the	corporate	 bond	market	increased	 marginally 	
to	₹5,718	crore	during	2023-24	from	₹5,549	crore	
in	the	previous	year	(Chart	II.5.5).

ECONOMIC REVIEW575. Equity Market 
II.5.14	In	 2023-24,	 the	Indian	equity	market	
remained	 ebullient	 on	strong	macroeconomic 	
fundamentals	 and	robust	corporate	 profitability. 	
The	BSE	Sensex	touched	a	new	high,	gaining	
24.9	per	cent	to	close	at	73,651	at	end-
March	2024,	outperforming	 most	global	peers  
(Chart	II.5.6).	The	exuberance	 of	the	secondary 	
market	translated	 into	increased	 resource	
mobilisation	 in	the	primary	market	as	well,	with	
initial	public	offer	(IPO)	issuances	 maintaining	 a	
steady	pace	and	resource	 mobilisation	 through	
preferential	 allotments	 and	qualified	institutional 	
placements	(QIPs)	also	growing	at	a	fast	clip.II.5.15	The	 markets	began	Q1:2023-24	 on	a	
positive	note	buoyed	by	solid	corporate	 earnings	
for	Q4:2022-23,	 upbeat	domestic	 manufacturing 	
performance,	 robust	goods	and	services	 tax	
(GST)	collections	 and	soft	inflation	print	for	May	
2023.	In	Q2,	the	markets	continued	 the	upward	
trajectory	 on	positive	domestic	 corporate	 results	
for	Q1:2023-24	 and	favourable	 macroeconomic 	
data,	notwithstanding	 some	drag	from	the	sharp	
correction	 in	China’s	equities	and	rising	concerns	
of	a	prolonged	 period	of	high	global	interest	rates.	
II.5.16	In	 Q3,	the	markets	initially	registered 	
losses	in	October	2023	due	to	FPI	outflows	and	
Middle	East	hostilities.	 Subsequently,	 domestic	
equity	indices	rebounded	 sharply,	propelled	 by	
positive	global	cues	from	softer-than-anticipated 	
inflation	prints	in	the	US	and	favourable	 domestic	
corporate	 earnings	for	Q2:2023-24.	 In	Q4:2023-
24,	markets	registered	 a	marginal	 increase.	
The	BSE	Sensex	crossed	the	74,000	mark	-	a	
fresh	peak	-	in	March	2024	following	strong	GDP	
growth	data	for	Q3:2023-24.
II.5.17	The	 broader	market	indices	outperformed 	
the	benchmark	 indices,	with	BSE	MidCap	and	
SmallCap	 indices	increasing	 by	63.4	per	cent	
and	60.1	per	cent,	respectively,	 during	2023-
24	on	increased	 risk	appetite	(Chart	II.5.7a).

II.5.20	The	 Indian	rupee	(INR)	exhibited	
resilience	 during	2023-24	on	improving	 domestic	
macroeconomic	 fundamentals,	 narrowing	 current	
account	deficit	(CAD)	and	higher	capital	inflows.	
In	Q1,	the	fall	in	crude	oil	prices	and	large	FPI	
inflows	imparted	an	appreciation	 bias	to	the	INR	
while	it	faced	downward	 pressures	 from	a	stronger	
US	dollar	and	the	impasse	around	the	US	debt-
ceiling	issue.	On	net,	the	INR	appreciated	 by	0.2	
per	cent	in	Q1	to	₹82.04	per	US	dollar	by	end-
June	2023.	In	Q2:2023-24,	 the	INR	came	under	
pressure,	 tracking	sharp	gains	in	the	US	dollar	
and	crude	oil	prices.	The	US	dollar	index	(DXY)	
gained	3.2	per	cent	during	the	quarter,	its	best	since	September	 2022,	on	expectations	 of	further	
monetary	 tightening	 by	the	US	Fed	and	its	higher	
for	longer	interest	rate	stance.	FPI	outflows	in	
September	 2023	added	to	pressure	on	the	INR	
while	reports	of	Indian	bonds’	inclusion	in	the	JP	
Morgan’s	 Emerging	 Market	Global	Bond	Index	
provided	some	support.	Overall,	the	INR	closed	
the	quarter	lower	by	1.2	per	cent	at	₹83.04	per	
US	dollar	(Chart	II.5.9).
II.5.21	During	 Q3:2023-24,	 the	increase	in	the	
US	treasury	yields	to	the	highest	levels	since	
2007,	and	a	rise	in	crude	oil	prices	amid	eruption	
of	geopolitical	 tensions	in	the	Middle	East	and

Thereafter,	 softening	 in	US	treasury	yields	and	
recovery	 in	FPI	inflows	during	November	 and

balance,	the	INR	closed	the	quarter	marginally

Q4:2023-24,	 stronger	US	dollar	and	higher	crude

II.6.1 The	general	 government	 finances	
consolidated	 during	2023-24	 with	its	deficit	
(per	cent	of	GDP)	declining	 due	to	buoyant	tax	
receipts	and	lower	revenue	spending.	 The	quality	
of	expenditure	 improved	 with	the	expansion 	
in	capital	outlays.	Against	this	backdrop,	 sub-
sections	2	and	3	analyse	central	government 	
finances	in	2023-24	and	2024-25,	 respectively. 	
Sub-sections	 4	and	5	focus	on	state	government 	
finances	during	these	years.	General	government 	
finances	are	discussed	 in	sub-section	 6.	The	final	
section	sets	out	concluding	remarks.
2. Central Government Finances in 2023-24
II.6.2 The	Union	government	 contained	 its	gross	
fiscal	deficit	(GFD)	for	2023-24	at	5.9	per	cent	of	
GDP	in	the	revised	estimates	 (RE)52,	in	line	with	
the	budget	estimates	(Chart	II.6.1).

BE: Budget Estimates.        RE: Revised Estimates.     
Note: Negative contribution denotes decline in receipts or increase in 
expenditure or a downward revision in GDP from BE to RE as these 
contribute to slippage from the budgeted fiscal deficit target. Conversely, 
positive contribution denotes higher receipts or lower expenditure from BE 
to RE, as these contribute to attainment of budgeted fiscal deficit target.

ECONOMIC REVIEW61II.6.3 Revenue	 expenditure	 turned	out	to	be	
higher	than	budgeted	 by	0.1	per	cent	of	GDP	
(₹38,103	 crore)	in	2023-24	 (RE),	reflecting	
additional	 spending	measures	 such	as	the	subsidy	
of	₹200	per	14.2	kg	LPG	cylinder	(announced	 in	
August	2023);	additional	 subsidy	of	₹100	per	
cylinder	for	beneficiaries	 of	the	Pradhan Mantri 
Ujjwala Yojana 	(PMUY)	scheme	(announced	 in	
October	2023);	extension	 of	the	Pradhan Mantri

years;	increased	 allocation	 of	funds	under	the	
Mahatma	 Gandhi	National	 Rural	Employment	
Guarantee	 Act	(MGNREGA)	 scheme;	and	higher	
outgoes	under	nutrient	based	fertiliser	subsidy	
(NBS).	Capital	expenditure,	 on	the	other	hand,	
fell	short	of	the	budget	estimates	 (BE)	by	₹50,715	
crore	due	to	lower	than	budgeted	 loans	and	
advances	 (₹20,640	 crore)	and	capital	outlay53 
(₹30,075	crore).	Nevertheless,	 capex	grew	at	a

rose	to	3.2	per	cent	of	GDP	from	2.7	per	cent	in	
2022-23.	
II.6.4 On	the	receipts	side,	gross	tax	revenues	
surpassed	 BE	by	₹76,353	crore,	driven	up	by	
higher	income	tax	revenues	which	offset	shortfalls	
in	excise	and	customs	collections.	 Income	tax	
recorded	a	buoyancy	 of	2.5	in	2023-24	(RE)	 vis-
à-vis	1.0	in	BE.	Net	tax	revenue,	 however,	 fell	
short	of	the	BE	by	0.02	per	cent	of	GDP	(₹6,713	
crore)	due	to	higher	devolution	 to	states.	Non-
tax	revenue	collections	 exceeded	 BE	by	0.3	per	
cent	of	GDP	(₹74,145	crore)	on	the	back	of	higher	
dividend	 transfers	 by	the	Reserve	 Bank	and	
public	sector	enterprises.	 Disinvestment	 receipts	
at	₹30,000	crore	in	2023-24	(RE)	were,	however,	
below	the	BE	(Chart	II.6.2).	3. Central Government Finances in 2024-25
II.6.5 The	interim	Union	Budget	2024-25	
underscored	 the	government’s	 commitment 	
to	fiscal	consolidation	 while	supporting	 growth	
impulses	 through	higher	capital	expenditure. 	 
The	GFD	has	been	budgeted	 at	5.1	per	cent	of 
GDP	for	2024-25,	 a	consolidation	 of	76	basis	
points	(bps)	over	the	RE	for	2023-24,	 led	by	
the	containment	 of	revenue	expenditure	 at	11.2	
per	cent	of	GDP,	even	as	capital	expenditure  
is	budgeted	 to	rise	to	3.4	per	cent	of	GDP	from	
3.2	per	cent	in	2023-24	(RE)	[Table	II.6.1	and	
Appendix	Table	6].
II.6.6 On	the	expenditure	 front,	payouts	on	
major	subsidies	 are	expected	 to	contract	by	7.8	
per	cent	in	2024-25	(BE),	restricting	 revenue	
spending	 growth	to	3.2	per	cent.	Capital	
expenditure	 is	expected	 to	remain	robust	in	 
2024-25	(growth	of	16.9	per	cent),	driven	by	
spending	 on	roads	and	railways	(Chart	II.6.3).

II.6.11 As	per	information	 available	for	27	states	
for	2024-25,	their	consolidated	 GFD-GSDP	 ratio	
is	budgeted	 at	3.0	per	cent	(Table	II.6.4).	Gross	
transfers	from	the	Centre	are	budgeted	to	increase	
by	8.4	per	cent	during	2024-25	(BE),	largely	due	
to	enhanced	 tax	devolution	 and	an	increase	in	
loans	for	capital	expenditure.	 The	scheme	of	 50-year	interest	free	loans	for	capital	expenditure	 to 
states	would	be	continued	 in	2024-25,	with	total	
outlay	of	₹1.3	lakh	crore	-	an	increase	of	23.2	
per	cent	over	2023-24	 (RE)	levels.	Finance	
commission	 grants	are,	however,	 expected	 to	
decline	in	2024-25,	primarily	due	to	lower	transfers

ECONOMIC REVIEW656. General Government Finances 
II.6.12 The	general	government	 deficit	and	debt	
moderated	 to	8.6	per	cent	and	81.6	per	cent	of	
GDP,	respectively,	 in	2023-24	(BE)	from	9.6	per	
cent	and	82.5	per	cent,	respectively,	 in	2022-23	
(RE),	respectively	 (Chart	II.6.7	and	Appendix	
Table	7).	The	reduction	in	the	general	government	
deficit	in	2023-24	was	supported	 by	an	increase	in	
tax	revenues	 [from	17.9	per	cent	of	GDP	in	2022-
23	(RE)	to	18.2	per	cent	in	2023-24	(BE)]	along

narrow	in	2024,	global	debt/GDP	ratios	will	remain

both	AEs	and	EMEs.
7. Conclusion
II.6.14 The	interim	Union	Budget	2024-25	
persevered	 with	consolidation,	 while	improving	 the	
quality	of	spending	through	higher	capital	outlays.	
Gross	market	borrowings 	are	placed	lower	in	
2024-25,	 which	would	enhance	 the	resources	
available	for	the	private	sector.	State	government	
budgets	for	2024-25	also	envisage	 containment	  
of	fiscal	deficits.	 Accordingly,	 the	general	
government	 deficit	is	expected	 to	decline	further	
in	2024-25,	which	bodes	well	for	macroeconomic	
stability.
II.7 EXTERNAL SECTOR
II.7.1	 India’s	 external	 sector	strengthened 	
during	2023-24	amidst	multiple	global	headwinds 	
emanating	 from	sharp	deceleration	 in	world	trade	
volumes,	financial	market	volatility	engendered	 by	
aggressive	 monetary	 policy	tightening	 actions	of	
systemic	central	banks	and	escalating	 geopolitical 	
tensions.	The	correction	 in	commodity	 prices	and	subdued	external	demand	led	to	a	contraction	 in	
merchandise	 exports	and	imports	(US$	terms)	
and	a	narrowing	 of	the	merchandise	 trade	deficit.	
The	buoyancy	 in	services	exports	and	private	
transfer	receipts	cushioned	 the	current	account	
deficit	(CAD).	Net	capital	flows	were	higher	than	
in	the	previous	year,	driven	by	portfolio	inflows	
and	banking	capital,	leading	to	an	accretion	 to	
foreign	exchange	reserves. 	
II.7.2	 Against	 this	backdrop,	 sub-section	 2	
presents	 a	brief	overview	 of	global	economic	
and	financial	conditions,	 followed	by	an	analysis	
of	India’s	merchandise	 exports	and	imports	in	
sub-section	 3.	The	behaviour	 of	invisibles	 is	
presented	 in	sub-section	 4.	Details	on	net	capital	
flows	are	set	out	in	sub-section	 5,	while	external	
vulnerability	 indicators	 are	examined	 in	sub-
section	6,	followed	by	concluding	observations.
2. Global Economic Conditions
II.7.3	 The	 global	economy	 sustained	 an	
uneven	expansion	 during	2023,	despite	tight	
financial	conditions,	 high	inflation,	geoeconomic 	
fragmentation	 and	geopolitical	 tensions.	 GDP	
growth	turned	out	to	be	somewhat	 stronger	than	
anticipated,	 driven	by	resilience	 in	the	US	and

ANNUAL REPORT 2023-2468II.7.6	 The	 decline	in	exports	in	2023-24	was	
broad-based,	 with	about	half	of	the	export	 
basket	recording	 a	fall.	The	contraction	 was	driven	
by	petroleum,	 oil	and	lubricants	 (POL)	and	gems	
and	jewellery.	 On	the	other	hand,	non-oil	non-
gems	and	jewellery	exports	witnessed	expansion 	
(Chart	II.7.4).II.7.7	 Apart	 from	petroleum	 products	and	gems	
and	jewellery,	 readymade	 garments	 (RMG)	of	all	
textiles,	organic	and	inorganic	chemicals	 and	rice	
contributed	 to	the	decline	in	merchandise	 exports.	
Electronic	 goods,	drugs	and	pharmaceuticals, 	
engineering	 goods,	iron	ore,	and	cotton	yarn/
fabs./made-ups,	 on	the	other	hand,	recorded	
expansion	(Chart	II.7.5).India’s	merchandise	 exports	rose	around	ten-fold	from	
US$	45	billion	in	2000-01	to	US$	437.1	billion	in	2023-24,	
interspersed	 by	episodes	 of	contraction	 and	surges.	An	
autoregressive	 distributed	 lag	(ARDL)	model	for	the	period	
Q1:2009	to	Q3:2023	indicates	that	the	long-run	elasticity	of	
India’s	merchandise	 export	volumes	with	respect	to	world	
merchandise	 trade	volumes	is	around	1.4.	Exports	are	also	
sensitive	to	relative	prices,	with	the	real	effective	exchange	
rate	(REER)	elasticity	at	around	(-)	0.5	(Table	1).	
The	short-run	 trade	elasticity	is	above	its	long-run	value,	
which	suggests	 that	global	demand	fluctuations	 have	a	
stronger	impact	on	India’s	exports	in	the	short-run.	 The	
speed	of	adjustment	 (ECM	term)	is	high,	 i.e.,	export	growth	
tends	to	revert	to	its	equilibrium	 path	quickly	following	
deviations	 from	the	trend.	Utilising	the	above	results,	India’s	
merchandise	 export	growth	is	decomposed	 into	structural	
and	cyclical	components	 (Constantinescu	 et. al.,	2020).	The	
analysis	suggests	that	the	 cyclical	component	 has	been	the	
major	driver	of	contraction	 in	merchandise	 export	volumes	
in	recent	quarters	(Chart	1).Box II.7.1

II.7.25	During	 2023-24	(April-December),	 capital

foreign	portfolio	 investment	 (FPI)	flows.	Net	
inflows	under	non-resident	 deposits	and	external	
commercial	 borrowings	 were	higher	than	a	year	
ago.	Net	foreign	direct	investment	 (FDI)	flows	
were,	however,	 lower	on	account	of	a	rise	in	
repatriation	 of	FDI	from	India.	Overall,	net	capital	
inflows	were	higher	while	CAD	moderated,	 leading	
to	an	accretion	 to	foreign	exchange	 reserves	on	
a	BoP	basis	(excluding	 valuation	effects)	by	US$	
32.9	billion	during	April-December	 (Chart	II.7.23	
and	Appendix	 Table	8).

net	outward	FDI)	flows	fell	to	US$	10.6	billion	
during	2023-24	from	US$	28.0	billion	a	year	ago.	
While	gross	inflows	by	non-residents	 remained	
resilient,	repatriation/disinvestment	 of	FDI	in	India	
increased	 (Table	II.7.2).	During	2023-24,	the	top	
FDI	source	countries	 were	Singapore,	 Mauritius,	
the	US,	the	Netherlands	 and	Japan,	contributing 	73.9	per	cent	(Chart	II.7.24).	Sector-wise,	 the

MONETARY POLICY OPERATIONS 81MONETARY POLICY OPERATIONSIIITHE ANNUAL REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE RESERVE BANK OF INDIA
PART TWO: THE WORKING AND OPERATIONS OF
THE RESERVE BANK OF INDIA
III.1 During 2022-23, the monetary policy 
committee (MPC) increased the policy repo rate 
by cumulative 250 bps. The impact of the increase 
in the repo rate and softening input cost pressures 
was reflected in a steady decline in core consumer 
price index (CPI) inflation (CPI excluding food and 
fuel). CPI headline inflation also eased into the 
tolerance band, although transient shocks from 
vegetable prices pushed it occasionally above the 
upper tolerance threshold. Disinflation costs were 
minimised by the resilience of domestic economic 
activity in spite of formidable global headwinds. 
Accordingly, the MPC maintained status quo on 
the policy repo rate and persevered with a stance 
of withdrawal of accommodation during 2023-24. 
III.2 During the year, liquidity conditions 
evolved in line with the monetary policy stance. 
An incremental cash reserve ratio (I-CRR) was 
applied as a temporary measure during August 12 
to October 7, 2023 to absorb the surplus liquidity 
resulting from the return of ₹2000 banknotes to 
the banking system. With system liquidity turning 
into a deficit in H2 on account of the build-up of 
government cash balances and festival related 
currency outgo, short-term money market rates firmed up. Long-term yields remained broadly 
stable. The Reserve Bank conducted two-way 
liquidity operations. The transmission of policy 
rate increases of 2022-23 to banks’ deposit and 
lending rates continued although its pace slowed 
during the course of the year. 
III.3 Against the above backdrop, section 2 
presents the implementation status of the agenda 
set for 2023-24 along with major developments 
during the year, while section 3 sets out the 
agenda for 2024-25. Concluding observations are 
provided in the last section.
2. Agenda for 2023-24
III.4 The Department had set out the following 
goals for 2023-24:
• Application of machine learning (ML) 
techniques for improving nowcasting and 
forecasting of gross domestic product 
(GDP) [Utkarsh 2.0] (Paragraph III.5);
• Strengthening the analysis of transmission 
to lending rates of non-banking financial 
companies (NBFCs) and sectoral lending 
by them (Utkarsh 2.0) [Paragraph III.5]; 
andWith the cumulative interest rate increases of 250 basis points (bps) undertaken in 2022-23, headline inflation 
moderated and moved into the tolerance band during 2023-24 amidst intermittent food price spikes even as 
economic activity exhibited resilience. The monetary policy committee (MPC) kept the policy repo rate unchanged 
and maintained the stance of withdrawal of accommodation through 2023-24. The pace of transmission to banks’ 
deposit and lending rates moderated. Liquidity conditions evolved in sync with the monetary policy stance.

ANNUAL REPORT 2023-2482• A review of the working of the external 
benchmark system for loans in monetary 
policy transmission (Utkarsh 2.0) 
[Paragraph III.5].
Implementation Status
III.5 The nowcasting and forecasting models 
used for short-term projections of GDP were 
augmented by employing linear and non-linear ML 
techniques using high frequency indicators. Data 
on transmission and sectoral deployment of credit 
from major NBFCs are being collected and efforts 
are underway to streamline the data submission 
process under the centralised information 
management system (CIMS). A detailed review 
of the external benchmark-based lending rate 
(EBLR) system was conducted. Feedback and 
suggestions have been received from banks.
III.6 Studies were carried out during the year 
(i) to assess properties of various core inflation 
measures in view of recurrent inflation shocks 
in recent years; (ii) to gauge the impact of the 
surge in digital payments on currency demand; 
(iii) to extract expectations on the policy rate from 
the 2-month overnight index swaps (OIS); (iv) to 
evaluate the operation of the standing deposit 
facility (SDF) after one year of its introduction;  
(v) to compare monetary transmission in the 
current tightening cycle vis-à-vis the previous 
easing phase; and (vi) to examine the pass-
through of input prices to output prices in a 
cross-country framework.
Major Developments
Monetary Policy
III.7 When the MPC met for its first meeting 
of 2023-24 in April, CPI headline inflation had 
accelerated to 6.4 per cent in February 2023 from 5.7 per cent in December 2022 amidst high inflation 
in several food sub-groups. The outlook for inflation 
remained uncertain in the backdrop of unseasonal 
rains and hailstorms, the lagged pass-through of 
input costs pressures into output prices, global 
financial market volatility and imported inflation 
risks, especially from crude oil prices. Assuming 
an annual average crude oil price (Indian basket) 
at US$ 85 per barrel and a normal monsoon, CPI 
inflation was projected at 5.2 per cent for 2023-24, 
with Q1 at 5.1 per cent, Q2 at 5.4 per cent, Q3 at 5.4 
per cent and Q4 at 5.2 per cent, with risks evenly 
balanced. Real GDP growth for 2023-24 was 
projected at 6.5 per cent, underpinned by a good 
rabi crop, sustained buoyancy in contact-intensive 
services, the government’s thrust on capex, and 
double digit credit growth. The MPC unanimously 
decided to keep the policy repo rate unchanged 
at 6.50 per cent in April 2023 after six sequential 
rate hikes during 2022-23. The MPC emphasised 
that it would continue to keep a strong vigil on the 
evolving inflation and growth outlook and take 
further action, if required. The MPC also decided to 
remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation 
to ensure that inflation progressively aligns to the 
target while supporting growth, with a 5-1 vote.
III.8 With inflation dipping into the tolerance 
band during March-April 2023, under the 
combined impact of monetary tightening and 
supply augmenting measures, and domestic 
activity remaining resilient, the MPC maintained 
status quo on policy rate by a unanimous decision 
and maintained the stance with a 5-1 vote in its 
June 2023 meeting. It noted that the cumulative 
rate hike of the past was still transmitting through 
the economy and its fuller impact should keep 
inflationary pressures contained in the coming 
months. The MPC resolved to take further 
monetary actions, as required, to keep inflation 

MONETARY POLICY OPERATIONS 83expectations firmly anchored and to bring down 
inflation to the target.
III.9 When the MPC met in August 2023, the 
global economy was slowing with divergent 
growth trajectories across regions. Inflation was 
moderating but ruled above the target. Tight 
financial conditions, simmering geopolitical 
conflicts and geoeconomic fragmentation were 
the main risks. Domestic CPI inflation picked up 
from 4.3 per cent in May to 4.8 per cent in June, 
driven largely by price pressures in food items, 
most prominently in tomatoes. The uneven south-
west monsoon, upward pressures on global food 
prices due to the hostile geopolitical environment 
and hardening crude oil prices on production cuts 
posed risks to the inflation outlook. Considering 
these factors and assuming a normal monsoon, 
the CPI inflation forecast was revised up to 5.4 
per cent for 2023-24, with Q2 at 6.2 per cent, Q3 
at 5.7 per cent and Q4 at 5.2 per cent, with risks 
evenly balanced. With the repo rate increases 
still working their way into the economy, the MPC 
unanimously decided to keep the policy repo rate 
unchanged at 6.50 per cent with preparedness to 
undertake policy responses, should the situation 
so warrant. The MPC also reiterated its stance of 
withdrawal of accommodation with a 5-1 vote.
III.10 At the time of the October 2023 meeting, 
global growth was losing momentum but domestic 
real GDP had registered robust growth in 
Q1:2023-24. CPI headline inflation, after surging 
by 2.6 percentage points to 7.4 per cent in July 
due to a spike in vegetable prices, moderated to 
6.8 per cent in August. Core inflation continued 
its descent in July-August. The MPC observed 
that the unprecedented food price shocks were 
impinging on the evolving trajectory of inflation 
and the recurring incidence of such overlapping  
shocks could impart generalisation and persistence. It noted that with headline inflation 
above the tolerance band, monetary policy 
needed to remain actively disinflationary. The 
MPC unanimously decided to keep the policy repo 
rate unchanged at 6.50 per cent while retaining its 
stance with a 5-1 vote.
III.11 By the time the MPC met in December 
2023, domestic economic activity had maintained 
resilience, underpinned by robust investment and 
government consumption. The projection of real 
GDP growth for 2023-24 was increased to 7.0 
per cent. CPI headline inflation fell by about 2 
percentage points to 4.9 per cent in October on 
sharp correction in prices of certain vegetables, 
deflation in fuel and a faster and broad-based 
disinflation in core prices. The CPI inflation forecast 
was retained at 5.4 per cent for 2023-24, with Q3 
at 5.6 per cent; and Q4 at 5.2 per cent. Assuming 
a normal monsoon for 2024-25, CPI inflation for 
Q1:2024-25 was projected at 5.2 per cent; Q2 at 
4.0 per cent; and Q3 at 4.7 per cent. The MPC 
unanimously decided to keep the policy repo rate 
unchanged at 6.50 per cent with readiness to take 
appropriate policy actions as and when required 
and retained its stance with 5-1 vote.
III.12 Against the backdrop of continued 
momentum in economic activity, the MPC in its 
February meeting projected real GDP growth for 
2024-25 at 7.0 per cent. CPI inflation had picked 
up in November and December, primarily on 
account of vegetable price increases, even as fuel 
deflation deepened and core inflation softened 
to a four year low of 3.8 per cent in December 
2023. CPI inflation was projected at 5.4 per cent 
for 2023-24 with Q4 at 5.0 per cent. Assuming a 
normal monsoon, CPI inflation for 2024-25 was 
projected at 4.5 per cent with Q1 at 5.0 per cent; 
Q2 at 4.0 per cent; Q3 at 4.6 per cent; and Q4 at 
4.7 per cent, with risks evenly balanced. While 

ANNUAL REPORT 2023-2484domestic activity was holding up well, large and 
repetitive food price shocks were interrupting the 
pace of disinflation. The MPC decided to keep the 
policy repo rate unchanged at 6.50 per cent with 
a 5-1 vote to sustain the path of disinflation. The 
MPC noted that monetary policy must continue 
to be actively disinflationary to ensure anchoring 
of inflation expectations and fuller transmission.  The MPC also decided to remain focused on 
withdrawal of accommodation with a 5-1 vote.
III.13 The MPC’s decisions during 2023-24 
were marked by unanimity on rate actions barring 
the February meeting, but diversity in stance 
(Chart III.1). 
III.14 Globally, many central banks have kept 
rates on hold since mid-2023 (Table III.1).
III.15 Monetary policy communication has 
gained prominence in anchoring expectations of 
economic agents (Box III.1).
The Operating Framework: Liquidity Management
III.16 In consonance with the monetary policy 
stance, liquidity management operations during 
2023-24 were aimed at balancing out the level 
of liquidity in the banking system. Keeping in 
view the increase in surplus liquidity due to 
various factors (discussed below), the Reserve 
Bank imposed an incremental cash reserve 
ratio (I-CRR) of 10 per cent on the increase 
in net demand and time liabilities (NDTL) of all  
scheduled banks between May 19 and July 28, 
2023, effective from the fortnight beginning  Table III.1: Policy Rates – Major Central Banks

MONETARY POLICY OPERATIONS 85Communication is an important strategy of central banks 
which fosters transparency and credibility of their policy 
announcements. The Reserve Bank’s communication on 
monetary policy includes the MPC’s resolutions, minutes of 
the MPC’s meetings, Governor’s statement, the Monetary 
Policy Report (MPR), press conferences on the day of 
announcement of the policy and the speeches delivered on 
various occasions. 
An analysis of MPC’s resolutions using natural language 
processing (NLP) techniques shows that the emphasis of 
communication varied, depending on situations; seven 
key topics emerged during October 2016 to October 
2023 (Chart 1). Inflation remained as the central topic of 
discussion, followed by growth during the pre-COVID-19 
period (October 2016 to February 2020). This sequence, 
however, reversed during the pandemic (March 2020 to 
February 2022); liquidity and COVID topics also received 
attention. The geopolitical crisis in 2022 and the resultant 
inflationary pressures shaped subsequent MPC discussions 
with inflation returning as the core topic (March 2022 
to October 2023); the focus on external linkages also 
increased.
As communication can supplement quantitative changes 
in the policy repo rate and impact financial markets, 
communication tone of monetary policy was used for 
analysis1. Communication tone on inflation resonated 
well with the policy cycle; during the tightening period, the 
tone was negative, while it was positive during the easing 
cycle. The tone on growth remained positive or negative, 
depending on prevailing economic conditions. Box III.1
 Monetary Policy Communication in India
The impact of the weighted average call rate (WACR) [which 
mirrors changes in the policy repo rate], communication tone 
on inflation (MPC_INF) and growth (MPC_GR) is assessed 
on the overnight index swap (OIS) rates in an event-
study approach (a five-day window before and after policy 
announcement). The analysis suggests that the WACR 
drives short-term OIS rates, but its influence decreases 
as the tenor increases (Table 1). The OIS rates exhibit a 
weak and insignificant correlation with communication 
tone on growth. Conversely, they have significant inverse 
relationship with inflation tone. Further, communication 
on inflation matters more during policy tightening phases 
(Table 2). 
An analysis of inflation outlook of professional forecasters 
reveals that both inflation projections (quantitative) and 
inflation tone influence their forecasts. When projection 
is lower and the tone is positive, moderation is seen in 
professionals’ forecasts and vice versa (Table 3).

ANNUAL REPORT 2023-2486August 12, 20232. The I-CRR was reviewed on 
September 8, 2023, and discontinued in a phased 
manner so that system liquidity was not subjected 
to sudden shocks and money markets functioned 
in an orderly manner. Accordingly, 25 per cent 
of the impounded I-CRR funds was released on 
September 9, another 25 per cent on September 
23 and the remaining 50 per cent was released on 
October 7, 2023.Drivers and Management of Liquidity
III.17 Government cash balances, currency 
movements and capital flows emerged as the 
major drivers of liquidity during 2023-24 (Table 
III.2). At the beginning of Q1:2023-24, liquidity 
conditions tightened in April due to the build-up 
of government cash balances and the repayment 
of remaining funds availed by banks under the 
targeted long-term repo operations (TLTROs)3 Table 2: Impact of Communication on OIS Rates - Different Policy Cycles

2 The existing cash reserve ratio (CRR), however, remained unchanged at 4.5 per cent.
3 Out of the total availed funds of ₹1,12,900 crore, banks repaid ₹61,113 crore during April 2023.

MONETARY POLICY OPERATIONS 87conducted in April 2020. Thereafter, liquidity 
conditions eased in May in the wake of (i) the return 
of currency to the banking system consequent 
upon the withdrawal of ₹2000 banknotes from 
circulation; (ii) an accelerated pace of government 
spending before the onset of the monsoon season; 
and (iii) the Reserve Bank’s market operations. 
In June, advance tax payments and goods and 
services tax (GST) related outflows moderated 
surplus liquidity, though the seasonal return of 
currency to the banking system ameliorated 
some of the pressure. A 14-day variable rate repo 
(VRR) auction (main operation) was conducted 
on May 19, 2023 followed by one fine-tuning 
VRR operation in June to assuage the transient 
tightness in liquidity conditions. 
III.18 In Q2, liquidity conditions remained largely 
comfortable during July and the first half of August 
as government spending augmented surplus 
liquidity in the banking system. Surplus liquidity 
moderated from August 12, 2023, following 
the imposition of the I-CRR, which impounded 
about ₹1.1 lakh crore from the banking system. The build-up of government cash balances due 
to advance tax collections and GST payments 
further tightened liquidity conditions and average 
net liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) slipped 
into deficit mode in September for the first time 
since May 2019. Consequently, average net 
LAF absorption moderated to ₹0.89 lakh crore in 
Q2:2023-24 from ₹1.26 lakh crore in Q1. 
III.19 Liquidity turned into deficit with average 
net LAF injection of ₹0.76 lakh crore in Q3, driven 
by festival related currency outgo in October-
November and build-up of government cash 
balances due to advance tax and GST payments 
in December 2023. To alleviate the liquidity stress, 
the Reserve Bank conducted four fine-tuning  
VRR operations. 
III.20 Net LAF injection averaged ₹1.36 lakh 
crore in Q4, with injections narrowing considerably 
in March 2024 from January-February. Increased

ANNUAL REPORT 2023-2488return-leg of a USD/INR Sell Buy swap auction for 
US$ 5 billion conducted by the Reserve Bank on 
March 8, 2022 also injected liquidity amounting 
to ₹42,800 crore on March 11, 2024. During Q4, 
the Reserve Bank injected liquidity through six 
main and 19 fine-tuning VRR operations. At the 
same time, fine-tuning variable rate reverse repo 
(VRRR) auctions were conducted intermittently 
to absorb surplus liquidity to ensure that money 
market rates evolve in alignment with the monetary 
policy stance.
III.21 Currency in circulation is usually a 
predominant driver of structural liquidity in the 
banking system. The usual expansion in currency 
in circulation during 2023-24 was muted due to the 
return of currency to the banking system on account 
of the decision to withdraw ₹2000 banknotes from 
circulation on May 19, 2023 (Chart III.2).
Liquidity Operations
III.22 During 2023-24, average absorption under 
the SDF at ₹0.90 lakh crore constituted 78 per 
cent of the average daily total absorption (₹1.16 
lakh crore) under the LAF, while the remaining 22 
per cent was absorbed through VRRR auctions – both main and fine-tuning operations (Chart III.3). 
Reflecting tight liquidity conditions, banks’ recourse 
to the marginal standing facility (MSF) increased, 
with average daily borrowing under the facility 
amounting to ₹0.50 lakh crore during 2023-24, 
scaling a peak of ₹2.34 lakh crore on November 22, 
2023. The simultaneous placement of substantial 
funds under the SDF while taking large recourse 
to the MSF is somewhat paradoxical. To enable Chart III.2: Currency in Circulation

MONETARY POLICY OPERATIONS 89better fund management by the banks, it was 
decided to allow reversal of liquidity facilities under 
both the SDF and the MSF even during weekends 
and holidays with effect from December 30, 2023. 
This provided banks with greater flexibility in their 
operations, alleviated the tightness in liquidity 
conditions during the weekends and imparted 
greater efficiency to liquidity management. 
III.23 During 2023-24, VRRR fine-tuning 
operations and fortnightly 14-day main operations 
elicited average offer-cover ratios of 0.47 and 
0.38, respectively. In contrast, VRR fine-tuning 
and main operations had average bid-cover ratio 
of 2.07 and 1.75, respectively, reflecting tight 
liquidity conditions.
III.24 Driven by the shifting liquidity dynamics, 
the weighted average call rate (WACR) – the 
operating target of monetary policy – remained 
elevated during October 2023-January 2024. It 
eased between mid-February 2024 and the third 
week of March before hardening towards the year-
end (Chart III.4).III.25 In tandem with the WACR, overnight rates 
in the collateralised segment rose during the year 
before easing since February (Table III.3). In the 
term money segment, yields firmed up on 3-month 
commercial paper (CP) for NBFCs, reflecting, inter 
alia, the regulatory measures announced by the 
Reserve Bank on November 16, 2023 (see Chapter 
VI). Tight liquidity conditions prompted banks 
to resort to issuances of certificates of deposit 
(CDs). Medium to long-term bond yields, however, 
eased from their March 2023 levels, taking cues 
from domestic developments notwithstanding the 
hardening of US treasury yiel ds.

ANNUAL REPORT 2023-2490Monetary Polic y Transmission
III.26 The transmission of the Reserve Bank’s 
policy rate changes to banks’ deposit and 
lending rates continued during 2023-24, albeit  
at a decelerated pace. Scheduled commercial 
banks’ (SCBs’) weighted average lending rate 
(WALR) on fresh rupee loans and WALR on 
outstanding loans increased by 5 bps and 13 
bps, respectively, during 2023-24. In the case of 
deposits, the weighted average domestic term 
deposit rate (WADTDR) on outstanding term 
deposits increased in 2023-24, with an increasing 
proportion of deposits getting renewed at higher 
rates. The WADTDR on fresh term deposits 
increased by 14 bps during the year. Overall, 
since the beginning of the current tightening 
cycle in May 2022, banks have revised their  
repo-linked benchmark rates upwards by 250 bps 
and their 1-year marginal cost of funds-based 
lending rates (MCLR) by 167 bps. Consequently, 
the WALR on fresh rupee loans rose by 186 bps 
while that on outstanding loans rose by 113 bps during May 2022-March 2024. The WADTDR 
on fresh term deposits and outstanding term 
deposits increased by 259 bps and 185 bps, 
respectively, over the same period (Table III.4). 
III.27 In the current tightening cycle, the interest 
rates on savings deposits of banks - which 
account for roughly 30 per cent of total deposits - 
have remained almost unchanged, while current 
account balances (with around 9 per cent share 
in total deposits at end-March 2024) earn no 
interest. This has moderated the increase in the 
banks’ overall cost of funds, mirroring in higher 
interest rate spreads. During tightening cycles, 
interest rate spreads of SCBs tend to widen 
initially with faster upward adjustments in lending 
rates relative to deposit rates (Box III.2). With the 
phased repricing of deposits, net interest margins 
moderate/stabilise subsequently.
III.28 Across bank-groups, the increase in the 
WALR on fresh rupee loans and WADTDR on 
fresh and outstanding term deposits was higher

MONETARY POLICY OPERATIONS 91in case of public sector banks (PSBs) relative to 
private banks (PVBs) in the current tightening 
cycle (Chart III.5). The transmission was the 
highest in the case of foreign banks, facilitated 
by their low cost and lower duration deposits, 
which enables them to make quicker adjustments 
in response to policy rate changes.External Benchmark-based Loan Rates
III.29 The external benchmark regime 
introduced in October 2019 for loan pricing in 
select sectors has strengthened the pace of 
monetary transmission to the lending rates. The 
proportion of outstanding floating rate loans linked 
to external benchmarks increased from 44 per The interest rate spread (IRS) - the difference between 
the weighted average lending rate on fresh loans and the 
weighted average rate on total deposits of banks - impacts 
monetary transmission. Drawing from Arellano-Bover (1995) 
and Blundell & Bond (1998), a dynamic panel framework 
using the system generalised method of moments 
(Roodman, 2009) on quarterly data of 27 SCBs (12 public 
and 15 private sector banks) for the period Q4:2018-19 
to Q1:2023-24 with bank-specific control variables, viz., 
size (log of total assets of banks), gross non-performing 
asset   (GNPA) ratio, capital to risk-weighted assets ratio 
(CRAR) and credit-deposit (CD) ratio indicates that a 100 
bps increase in the WACR increases banks’ IRS in the 
short-run by 15-17 bps, as the pace of upward adjustment 
in term deposit rates lags that in lending rates. The model 
takes the following form: 
,=µ +=1 ,( )+=0  +

where, Xb,t represents the bank-specific variables for bank

over the same period (Table III.5).
III.30 In the case of loans linked to the policy

ANNUAL REPORT 2023-2494evaluation of credit conditions and sectoral flows. 
Against this backdrop, the Department would 
focus on the following:
 ●Strengthening further the analysis of 
transmission of policy impulses to lending 
rates of NBFCs (Utkarsh 2.0);
 ●Measuring the sectoral credit flows of 
NBFCs (Utkarsh 2.0);
 ●Examining the feasibility of introduction of 
the EBLR system of loan pricing for credit 
extended by NBFCs to select sectors;
 ●Computing a financial conditions index for 
India;
 ●Studying behaviour of banks under varying 
reserve requirements; and
 ●Publishing CPI diffusion indices . 4. Conclusion
III.34 Going forward, on the basis of 
the experience gained in 2023-24, strong 
macroeconomic fundamentals are expected to 
support domestic economic activity. Headline 
inflation is expected to moderate further, although 
its trajectory would depend critically upon the 
evolving supply-side and weather conditions. 
While proactive supply-side interventions by 
the government are critical to keep food price 
pressures under check, monetary policy will 
remain resolute in its pursuit of price stability so 
that inflation is aligned with its target of 4 per cent 
on a durable basis and inflation expectations 
are anchored. The Reserve Bank will undertake 
liquidity management operations in sync with the 
monetary policy stance while meeting the needs 
of the productive sectors of the economy.

CREDIT DELIVERY AND FINANCIAL INCLUSION95CREDIT DELIVERY AND  
FINANCIAL INCLUSION IV
IV. 1  During 2023-24, the Reserve Bank 
continued with initiatives to deepen financial 
inclusion and improve credit delivery to 
agriculture, micro, small and medium enterprises 
(MSMEs), and other identified priority sectors. 
The composite financial inclusion index  
(FI-Index),  a comprehensive indicator of financial 
inclusion across the country, registered a  
year-on-year (y-o-y) growth of 6.6 per cent to 
60.1 in March 2023,  with expansion across all 
the sub-indices. A Financial Inclusion Dashboard 
- ANTARDRISHTI -  was launched in June 2023 
to strengthen policy insights for assessing and 
monitoring the progress of financial inclusion 
by capturing broad parameters under the three 
dimensions of financial inclusion, viz., Access, 
Usage and Quality. To provide further impetus to 
financial literacy, the CFL project was scaled up 
to 2,421 CFLs covering 7,225 blocks as at end-
March 2024. The Reserve Bank also conducted 
all-India quiz on financial literacy for students of 
government and municipal schools across the 
country. 
IV. 2  Against this backdrop, the rest of the 
chapter is structured into three sections. The 
implementation status of the agenda for 2023-
24 along with the performance of credit flow to 
priority sectors and developments with respect 
to financial inclusion and financial literacy are 
presented in section 2. The agenda for 2024-25 is provided in section 3 with concluding observations 
in section 4.
2. Agenda for 2023-24 
IV. 3  The Department had set the following 
goals for 2023-24: 
•	Setting up CFLs in the remaining blocks 
so as to cover the entire country (Utkarsh 
2.0) [Paragraph IV.4]; and
•	Working towards the deliverables of G20 
Global Partnership for Financial Inclusion 
(GPFI) [Paragraph IV.5].
Implementation Status 
IV. 4  The pilot CFL project, initiated in 2017 
with the objective of exploring innovative and 
participatory approaches to financial literacy at 
the block level, has been scaled up based on 
experiences gained since its implementation. 
As a part of the National Strategy for Financial 
Inclusion (NSFI), it was envisaged to expand the 
reach of CFLs to cover the entire country by March 
31, 2024. In consonance with this milestone, 
the CFL project was rolled out in three phases 
across the country. Starting with 80 CFLs, initially 
covering an equal number of blocks in the pilot 
phase, the project has expanded to 2,421 CFLs 
catering to 7,225 blocks, as on March 31, 2024. 
Funding support for the project is provided by the 
Depositor Education Awareness Fund (DEAF), The Reserve Bank continued with its agenda for furthering financial inclusion in the country as envisaged under 
the National Strategy for Financial Inclusion (NSFI). Steps were taken for scaling up the Centre for Financial 
Literacy (CFL) project to cover the entire country by end-March 2024. The Reserve Bank conducted all-India 
quiz on financial literacy for students of classes VIII to X for enhancing financial literacy.

ANNUAL REPORT 2023-2496the Financial Inclusion Fund (FIF) of the National 
Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development 
(NABARD) and the sponsor banks. The financial 
literacy camps conducted by these CFLs aim to 
further financial literacy at the grass root level  
and achieve certain end-outcomes such as 
accounts opening/reactivation, pension and 
insurance linkages and awareness on grievance 
redressal.

CREDIT DELIVERY AND FINANCIAL INCLUSION97Bank Credit to the MSME Sector
IV. 8   Increasing the flow of credit to the MSMEs 
has been a policy priority of the Reserve Bank 
and the Government of India. On a y-o-y basis, 
the outstanding credit to the MSMEs by SCBs 
expanded by 20.9 per cent during 2023-24 (up to 
end-December 2023) [Table IV.3]. 
Measures for the MSME Sector
IV. 9  In terms of extant regulatory guidelines, 
lenders are required to obtain ‘Udyam   
Registration Certificate (URC)’ for classification  
of entities as MSMEs. To facilitate formalisation  
of informal micro enterprises (IMEs), which were 
not able to register on the ‘Udyam Registration 
Portal’ due to lack of mandatory documents, the 
Ministry of MSME, Government of India, has 
launched an ‘Udyam Assist Platform’ (UAP). The 
Reserve Bank has advised its regulated entities 
that the certificate issued on the UAP shall be 
treated on par with the URC, thus facilitating, for 
the purpose of PSL classification, the recognition 
of IMEs as micro enterprises under MSME.National Mission for Capacity Building of Bankers 
for Financing MSME Sector 
IV. 10  A special capacity building programme 
‘National Mission for Capacity Building of Bankers 
for Financing MSME Sector (NAMCABS)’ has 
been in place since 2015 to familiarise bankers 
with the entire gamut of credit related issues of 
the MSME sector and developing entrepreneurial 
sensitivity amongst them. The programme 
structure has been revamped to incorporate new 
developments in the MSME sector focusing on 
emerging thrust areas. During 2023-24, a total 
of 3,950 bank officials participated in NAMCABS 
programme conducted by the regional offices of 
the Reserve Bank.

CREDIT DELIVERY AND FINANCIAL INCLUSION99Financial Inclusion Index (FI-Index)
IV. 15  To achieve the financial inclusion goals 
and objectives, the measurement and evaluation 
of financial inclusion assumes importance. 
Towards this direction, a composite FI-Index 
was constructed and published by the Reserve 
Bank in August 20212. The FI-Index comprises of 
three broad sub-indices (weights in parentheses),  
viz., Access (35 per cent), Usage (45 per cent), 
and Quality (20 per cent) with each of these 
consisting of various dimensions, in turn, based on a number of indicators. The FI-Index for March 
2023 rose to 60.1 from 56.4 in March 2022, with 
growth witnessed across all the sub-indices 
(Chart IV.1).
Financial Inclusion Dashboard - ANTARDRISHTI
IV. 16  To assess and monitor the progress 
of financial inclusion and to gauge the extent 
of financial exclusion, a Financial Inclusion 
Dashboard - ANTARDRISHTI - was launched in 
June 2023 (Box IV.1).
National Strategy for Financial Inclusion (NSFI) 
2019-24 
IV. 17  The objective of NSFI is to deepen and 
sustain financial inclusion efforts at the national 
level with the coordination of all the stakeholders. 
The NSFI lays down action plans and milestones 
and suggests broad recommendations to be 
completed within the period of the strategy. Five 
recommendations earmarked to be implemented 
during 2023-24, focused on leveraging 
developments in FinTech space, moving 
towards an increasingly digital and consent-
based architecture for customer onboarding, 
strengthening process literacy, expanding the 
reach of CFLs, and articulation/monitoring of 
responsibilities of stakeholders.

The Financial Inclusion Dashboard - ANTARDRISHTI - 
aims to monitor the progress on relevant parameters at the 
national level with drill-down facility for regional, state and 
district level information. Some of the parameters captured 
by the dashboard include credit to deposit (CD) ratio, credit 
linkage of farmers and self-help groups (SHGs), credit 
disbursement to priority sectors and progress in financial 
literacy programmes. The dashboard has facilities in the Box IV.1

form of colour-coded heat maps, quick tickers and trend 
charts to assess regional disparities in the availability of 
banking facilities and flow of credit in multiple dimensions 
so as to address factors leading to financial exclusion. The 
dashboard, therefore, serves as an effective management 
information tool, besides providing insights to front-line 
functionaries.

ANNUAL REPORT 2023-24102FINANCIAL MARKETS AND 
FOREIGN EXCHANGE MANAGEMENTV
V.1 During 2023-24, the Reserve Bank 
undertook several measures to further 
develop and deepen financial markets through 
augmentation of the participation base in various 
segments, facilitation of access and transaction 
norms, and expansion in the range of financial 
products, while ensuring market integrity 
through rigorous surveillance. The Financial 
Markets Regulation Department (FMRD) issued 
Directions to the Reserve Bank regulated entities 
on transition away from the London Interbank 
Offered Rate (LIBOR) to alternative benchmarks; 
permitting scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) 
to set their own limits for borrowing in call and 
notice money markets within the prudential 
limits for interbank liabilities prescribed by the 
Reserve Bank; expanding the list of specified 
securities under the fully accessible route (FAR) 
by inclusion of sovereign green bonds; and 
allowing borrowing and lending of government 
securities (G-secs). The liquidity management 
operations of the Reserve Bank evolved in sync 
with its monetary policy stance. The Reserve 
Bank ensured orderly financial market conditions 
despite bouts of volatility in global financial 
markets. 
V.2 The Reserve Bank continued to facilitate 
external trade and investment, with focus on 
enhancing the ease of doing business and 
reduce the compliance burden for regulated entities. Accordingly, the Foreign Exchange 
Department (FED) reviewed several extant 
guidelines such as authorisation framework of 
the authorised persons (APs) under the Foreign 
Exchange Management Act (FEMA), 1999; 
rationalisation of liberalised remittance scheme 
(LRS); rationalisation of guarantee and trade 
regulations; and supervisory framework for full-
fledged money changers (FFMCs) and non-bank 
Authorised Dealer (AD) Category II. 
V.3 Against this backdrop, the rest of the 
chapter is structured into four sections. The 
development and regulation of financial markets 
are covered in section 2. The Reserve Bank’s 
market operations are discussed in section 3. 
In section 4, the focus is on external trade and 
payments and measures relating to liberalisation 
and development of external financial flows.

(Paragraph V.6);
 ●Review of the regulatory framework with a 
view to enhancing operational efficiencies, 
easing access to the foreign exchange 
derivative market for users with small 
foreign exchange (FX) exposures and 
ensuring that a broader set of customers 
with the necessary risk management 
expertise are equipped with the flexibility 
to manage their hedging programme 
efficiently (Paragraph V.7); and
 ●Review of the reporting and disclosure 
framework for trade repositories (TRs) 
of over-the-counter (OTC) derivative 
transactions to enhance market 
transparency (Utkarsh 2.0) [Paragraph 
V.8].
Implementation Status   
V.6 Based on the feedback received, final 
Directions mandating exchange of initial margin 
for NCCDs have been issued on May 8, 2024.
V.7 The regulatory framework governing the 
hedging of FX risks was reviewed and Directions 
were issued on January 5, 2024.
V.8 A review of the reporting and disclosure 
framework for the TRs of OTC derivatives was 
undertaken. Directions for reporting of OTC 
derivatives were consolidated and rationalised. A 
framework for dissemination of data on the OTC 
derivative market has been put in place, based, 
inter alia, on the liquidity and diversity of the 
participant base in different derivative products. Major Initiatives

V.14 Pursuant to the announcement made in 
the Statement on Developmental and Regulatory 
Policies of the Reserve Bank on February 8, 2023, 
securities lending and borrowing in G-secs was 
permitted in December 2023 with the objective 
of providing investors an avenue to deploy their 
idle securities to enhance portfolio returns and 
deepen the G-sec market.
Review of Regulatory Framework for Financial 
Benchmark Administrators (FBAs)
V.15 The regulatory framework for FBAs - 
first issued in June 2019 - was reviewed and a 
comprehensive risk-based regulatory framework 
covering administration of all benchmarks  
related to financial markets regulated by the 
Reserve Bank was implemented in December 
2023 pursuant to an announcement made in the Statement on Developme ntal and Regulatory 
Policies on August 10, 2023. The framework 
requires FBAs to comply with governance 
and oversight arrangements, controls and 
transparency and eschew conflict of interest 
so as to assure the accuracy and integrity of 
benchmarks.
Review of the Directions on Commercial Paper 
(CP) and Non-Convertible Debentures (NCDs) 
V.16 Directions on CP and NCDs of original 
maturity up to one year were reviewed and 
revised Directions were issued in January 2024 
to bring consistency across products in terms of 
issuers, investors and other participants in these 
markets. 
Introduction of Bond Forwards on G-secs 
V.17 In order to expand the suite of interest 
rate derivatives available in the domestic financial 
market and to enable market participants, 
especially long-term investors to manage their 
cash flows and interest rate risk, draft Directions 
permitting bond forwards on G-secs were issued 
in December 2023 to solicit feedback from 
stakeholders. 
Review of the Regulatory Framework for Hedging 
of Foreign Exchange Risks
V.18 The regulatory framework governing 
foreign exchange derivative transactions was 
comprehensively reviewed and revised Directions 
were issued on April 7, 2020. Based on the 
experience gained in this regard, the regulatory 
framework for hedging of FX risks was reviewed 
and revised Directions were issued on January 5, 
2024. The Directions consolidated the previous 
rules and notifications in respect of all types of 

FINANCIAL MARKETS AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE MANAGEMENT105transactions - OTC and exchange traded - under 
a single Master Direction, expanded the suite of 
permitted FX derivative products and refined the 
user classification framework to enable a larger 
set of users with the necessary risk management 
capabilities to efficiently manage their risks.Inclusion of Indian G-secs in Global Bond Index
V.19 An important development in greater 
participation of foreign investors in the domestic 
bond market has been the announcement about 
the inclusion of Indian Government Bonds (IGBs) 
in major global bond indices (Box V.1).
The Indian bond market is one of the largest among 
emerging market economies (EMEs) with an estimated 
size of US$ 1.2 trillion. Spurred by reforms undertaken 
over the years, the gilt market in India has gained depth, 
liquidity and vibrancy, while exhibiting resilience. The FAR 
route for investment by foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) in 
certain specified G-secs without any macroprudential limits 
was introduced in April 2020. The basket of G-secs under 
the FAR has been periodically expanded with tenors of 5, 
7, 10, 14 and 30 years as well as sovereign green bonds. 
Measures to facilitate operational ease of investment by 
FPIs were also undertaken, including permitting banks 
to lend to FPIs for meeting margin requirements for their 
transactions in G-secs, and providing an extended window 
post closure of onshore market hours for reporting of 
trades. In parallel, access of non-residents, including FPIs, 
to domestic derivative markets has been enabled/eased 
to facilitate hedging of interest rate, foreign exchange and 
credit risks by these entities.
Following the introduction of the FAR in April 2020 and 
related market reforms, Indian Government Bonds (IGBs) 
have been under consideration for inclusion in major global 
bond indices. In 2021, IGBs were placed on the watchlist 
for inclusion in global bond indices by two major index 
providers. On September 21, 2023 one index provider 
announced the inclusion of IGBs in its emerging markets 
suite of indices with effect from June 2024, with government 
bonds issued under FAR and meeting the laid-out inclusion 
criteria,1 eligible for inclusion in the index. The inclusion is 
expected to take place in a staggered manner over a period 
of 10 months (starting June 28, 2024 through March 31, Box V.1
Salient Developments in the Indian Government Securities Market
2025) with one per cent incremental weight being added 
each month, thus, giving India an overall weight of 10 per 
cent in the index. On January 8, 2024, another index provider 
launched consultation to solicit feedback on the proposed 
inclusion of the India FAR bonds in its emerging market 
index. This was followed by the announcement on March 
5, 2024 that IGBs covered under the FAR and meeting the 
laid-out inclusion criteria2 would be included in its Emerging 
Market (EM) Local Currency Government Index and related 
indices. The bonds will initially be incorporated with a 
weight equivalent to 10 per cent of their full market value 
as of January 31, 2025, and will be increased in monthly 
increments of 10 per cent, progressively increasing to full 
market value by October 2025.
Market participants estimate that the inclusion of IGBs in 
the global bond indices would result in increased demand 
for G-secs from foreign investors and is expected to support 
yields, with potential positive spillovers to credit costs 
for corporates as well. While boosting the liquidity of the 
G-secs market and improving the price discovery process, 
the demand for hedging related products in the onshore 
market is also expected to increase.
Increased FPI inflows and greater non-resident participation 
in domestic markets could, however, add to volatility, 
especially during global risk-off situations. These risks 
are likely to be contained as index based investments are 
passive and non-resident investment in Indian G-secs at 
around 2 per cent of the outstanding stock is low in absolute 
terms and also relative to most Asian emerging market 
peers.
1 The index provider vide its 2023 EM Index Governance Results dated September 21, 2023, indicated that all FAR bonds with a notional 
outstanding above US$ 1 billion (equivalent) and at least 2.5 years of residual maturity shall be eligible for inclusion in the index. Further, 
India’s local currency debt rating of BBB- / BBB- / Baa3 (Fitch/S&P/Moody’s), makes it eligible for inclusion in the ‘GBI-EM Global Diversified 
IG 15% Cap’ index.
2 As per the inclusion criteria, securities must have a minimum amount outstanding of INR 10 billion and follow the general rules of the 
Emerging Market Local Currency Index such as requiring bonds to have a minimum maturity of one year .

ANNUAL REPORT 2023-24106Agenda for 2024-25
V.20 For the year 2024-25, the Department 
has set the following goals: 
 ●Better aggregation and transparency 
under the legal entity identifier (LEI) 
requirements for reporting of OTC 
derivative transactions; global identifiers 
for OTC derivative transactions (e.g.,  
unique transaction identifier) [Utkarsh  
2.0];
 ●Review of the regulatory framework for 
ETP authorisation for financial market 
instruments regulated by the Reserve 
Bank in sync with the evolution of the 
domestic financial markets and global 
best practices; and
 ●Development of a framework for self-
regulatory organisations (SROs) for 
financial markets regulated by the 
Reserve Bank.
3.  FINANCIAL MARKETS OPERATIONS 
DEPARTMENT (FMOD)
V.21 The FMOD is primarily responsible for 
the conduct of liquidity management operations 
in alignment with the stance of monetary policy 
and for ensuring orderly conditions in the forex 
market through both onshore and offshore 
market operations.
Agenda for 2023-24
V.22 During the year, the Department had set 
out the following goals:
 ●Liquidity management operations in 
line with the monetary policy stance 
(Paragraph V.23); ●Foreign exchange operations to curb 
undue volatility in the USD/INR exchange 
rate (Paragraph V.24); and
 ●Policy-oriented research and analysis on 
financial markets so as to guide market 
operations strategies on an ongoing basis 
(Utkarsh 2.0) [Paragraph V.25].
Implementation Status 
V.23 During 2023-24, liquidity management3 
was conducted through two-way operations - 
variable rate reverse repo (VRRR) and variable 
rate repo (VRR) auctions - in line with the 
evolving liquidity situation. The 14-day VRRR 
auction remained the main operation in H1:2023-
24 supplemented by incremental cash reserve 
ratio (I-CRR) amidst surplus liquidity conditions 
stemming from the withdrawal of ₹2000 
banknotes. The Reserve Bank also conducted 
VRR auctions of various tenors in response to 
frictional liquidity conditions associated with 
advance tax and goods and services tax (GST) 
outflows. Calibrated withdrawal of the I-CRR 
from early September eased liquidity conditions. 
The build-up of government cash balances and 
highly skewed liquidity distribution in the system 
prompted banks to take recourse to marginal 
standing facility (MSF) in Q3:2023-24, while 
also parking funds under the standing deposit 
facility (SDF). In response, the Reserve Bank 
undertook fine-tuning VRR operations of various 
tenors and allowed reversal of liquidity facilities 
under both SDF and MSF even during weekends 
and holidays. In Q4:2023-24, the Reserve Bank 
managed liquidity through the second-leg of a 
USD/INR sell buy swap auction for US$ 5 billion 
that was conducted on March 8, 2022, and main 
and fine-tuning VRR auctions of various tenors. 
3 Details relating to liquidity management operations are covered in Chapter III of this Report.

FINANCIAL MARKETS AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE MANAGEMENT107V.24 The INR experienced bouts of volatility 
stemming from global financial markets due to 
the monetary policy stance of the US Fed and 
lingering geopolitical tensions. While FPI inflows, 
softening of crude oil prices and easing of current 
account deficit supported the INR, a strong USD 
reflecting safe haven demand in the face of 
geopolitical tensions and expectations of higher 
interest rates for longer period in the US imposed 
downward pressure on the INR. The Reserve 
Bank intervened in the forex market through 
operations in the onshore/offshore OTC and 
exchange traded currency derivatives (ETCDs) 
segments to maintain orderly market conditions 
and contain excessive volatility in the exchange 
rate.
V.25 The Department undertook research and 
analytical work in areas covering portfolio flows 
and exchange rate volatility; volatility episodes 
and India’s forex reserves; and drivers of 
commercial paper rate spreads over the relevant 
benchmark.
Agenda for 2024-25
V.26 During 2024-25, the Department plans to 
achieve the following goals:
 ●Technological upgradation to facilitate 
smoother and more flexible liquidity 
management operations;
 ●Issuance of consolidated instructions on 
liquidity adjustment facility;
 ●Enhance intervention toolkit to undertake 
focused foreign exchange operations 
to curb undue volatility in the USD/INR 
exchange rate; and
 ●Policy-oriented research and analysis 
on financial markets to guide market 
operations strategies on an ongoing basis 
(Utkarsh 2.0).4. FOREIGN EXCHANGE DEPARTMENT (FED)
V.27 The FED is entrusted with the 
responsibility of fulfilling the objectives envisaged 
under the Foreign Exchange Management Act 
(FEMA), 1999. Accordingly, the Department 
continued its endeavours to facilitate external 
trade and payments during the year through 
framing of simple yet comprehensive, time-
consistent and more principle-based policies to 
enhance the ease of doing business and reduce 
compliance burden. A review/rationalisation of 
the extant regulations/rules/notifications issued 
under FEMA, in alignment with the prevailing 
macroeconomic conditions and evolving business 
practices and models, was also undertaken 
during the year. 
Agenda for 2023-24
V.28 The Department had set out the following 
goals for 2023-24:
 ●Review of Compounding Proceedings 
Rules under the Foreign Exchange 
Management Act (FEMA), 1999 (Utkarsh  
2.0) [Paragraph V.29];
 ●Review of the authorisation framework of 
authorised persons (APs) under FEMA 
(Utkarsh 2.0) [Paragraph V.30];
 ●Rationalisation of the Liberalised 
Remittance Scheme (LRS) [Utkarsh 2.0] 
(Paragraph V.31);
 ●Rationalisation of regulations on Foreign 
Exchange Management (Manner of 
Receipt and Payment) Regulations, 2016 
(Utkarsh 2.0) [Paragraph V.32];
 ●Review of guidelines related to Rupee 
accounts of non-residents (Utkarsh 2.0) 
[Paragraph V.33];

ANNUAL REPORT 2023-24108 ●Rationalisation of Foreign Exchange 
Management (Mode of Payment and 
Reporting of Non-Debt Instruments) 
Regulations, 2019 (Paragraph V.34);
 ●Review of supervisory framework for full-
fledged money changers and non-bank 
AD Category-II (Paragraph V.35);
 ●Rationalisation of guarantee regulations 
(Paragraph V.36); and
 ●Rationalisation/simplification of trade 
guidelines (Utkarsh 2.0) [Paragraph V.37].
Implementation Status
V.29 A review of the Foreign Exchange 
(Compounding Proceedings) Rules, 2023 
[to supersede the extant Foreign Exchange 
(Compounding Proceedings) Rules, 2000] is 
under process. The review includes, inter alia, 
enhancing monetary ceilings, i.e., the sum 
involved in such contraventions, for compounding 
them at various ranks of the Reserve Bank 
officers, enabling electronic and other online 
modes of payment of compounding fees, and 
streamlining the standard operating procedure 
(SOP) for cases involving various stages of 
investigation/adjudication by Directorate of 
Enforcement, Department of Revenue, Ministry 
of Finance, GoI. 
V.30 The licensing framework for APs issued 
under FEMA was last reviewed in March 2006. 
Since then, the number of APs has gone up 
considerably, while new business models have 
also emerged. Keeping in view the progressive 
liberalisation under FEMA, increasing integration 
of the Indian economy with the global economy, 
digitisation of payment systems and evolving 
institutional structure over the last two decades, 
it was decided to rationalise and simplify the licensing framework for APs to effectively 
meet the emerging requirements. Accordingly, 
the  draft licensing framework for APs under 
FEMA  was placed on the Reserve Bank’s 
website on December 26, 2023, seeking 
comments/feedbacks from all stakeholders. 
The draft framework would be finalised based 
on the feedback received and after due internal 
examination as well as consultation with the GoI.
V.31 Under LRS, ADs may freely allow 
remittances by resident individuals up to US$ 
2,50,000 per financial year (April-March) for any 
permitted current or capital account transaction. 
A comprehensive review to address various 
issues in the scheme covering,  inter alia, the legal 
framework, annual limit, permitted purposes, and 
repatriation requirements under the scheme is 
currently underway.
V.32 On December 21, 2023, a significant 
step was taken towards promoting the 
internationalisation of INR and supporting local 
currency settlement with partner countries through 
the issuance of Foreign Exchange Management 
(Manner of Receipt and Payment) Regulations, 
2023. The rationalised regulations, inter alia,  
include the following major amendments: 
 ●The regulations have been simplified 
thereby improving their readability and 
comprehension;
 ●The previous regulations allowed receipt/
payment in foreign currency only for 
freely convertible currencies. The revised 
regulations enable receipt/payment in 
any foreign currency, which would aid in 
local currency settlement with the partner 
countries; and
 ●The previous regulations allowed receipt/
payment in INR for all cross-border 

FINANCIAL MARKETS AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE MANAGEMENT109transactions (current as well as capital) 
for non-Asian Currency Union (ACU) 
countries, whereas such receipt/payment 
was not allowed in respect of some ACU 
countries (viz., Bangladesh, Myanmar, 
Pakistan and Maldives). The revised 
regulations now enable INR settlement 
for all ACU countries with regard to non-
trade related transactions, and for trade 
related transactions in accordance with 
the Directions issued by the Reserve 
Bank from time to time.
V.33 To promote the internationalisation of 
INR and support local currency settlement with 
partner countries, it is necessary to liberalise 
the regulations relating to INR accounts 
for non-residents. Accordingly, the Foreign 
Exchange Management (Deposit) Regulations  
[FEMA 5(R)], regarding INR accounts by non-
residents are currently being reviewed in 
consultation with the government. 
V.34 The proposals to rationalise the  mode 
of payment and reporting requirement related 
regulations, currently prescribed in terms of 
FEMA Regulation No. 395, are under review 
in the Department. The review would include 
necessary additions/modifications in the extant 
framework on account of various amendments 
notified by Government of India under the Foreign 
Exchange Management (Non-Debt Instruments) 
Rules, 2019.
V.35 A comprehensive review of supervisory 
framework for FFMCs and non-bank AD 
Category-II is being undertaken in sync with 
the ongoing review of the licensing framework 
for APs under FEMA. The revised guidelines/
instructions will be issued in due course.V.36 Regulations framed under Foreign 
Exchange Management (Guarantees) 
Regulations, 2000 are being reviewed to reflect 
the changing macroeconomic conditions, 
business needs and issues faced by persons 
resident in India, while conducting cross-border 
transactions. The exercise also intends to 
improve ease of doing business by minimising 
the need for approvals. 
V.37 To simplify the existing regulatory 
framework for trade transactions by moving 
towards a more principle-based approach, 
improving ease of doing business, and dispensing 
with redundant provisions/processes and various 
approvals, the rationalisation/simplification of 
trade guidelines is under process. 
Major Initiatives
Operationalisation of ‘APConnect’ – Online 
Application for FFMCs and Non-bank AD 
Category-II
V.38 As part of the endeavour towards 
digitalisation to simplify process and enhance 
ease of doing business, a new software 
application, ‘APConnect’, was successfully 
implemented in April 2023. The application, 
inter alia, facilitates processing of requests for 
licensing of FFMCs and non-bank AD Category-II 
entities, authorisation of Money Transfer Service 
Scheme (MTSS) agent, renewal of existing 
licence/authorisation and for submission of 
various statements/returns by APs. The system 
has significantly transformed the authorisation 
process, resulting in operational efficiencies, 
cost savings, reduced paperwork and manpower 
requirements for all stakeholders. It has also 
led to a marked improvement in the handling of 
associated work across regional offices (ROs) of 
the Reserve Bank. 

ANNUAL REPORT 2023-24110AD Category-II - Online Submission of Form A2 
V.39 As per the guidelines outlined in Master 
Direction on LRS, and Master Direction on Other 
Remittance Facilities, applicants are required to 
submit Form A2 while undertaking remittances 
other than for imports and intermediary trade 
transactions. Additionally, customers of AD 
banks offering internet banking facilities can 
submit Form A2 online for remittances up to US$ 
25,000 (or its equivalent) by individuals and up to 
US$ 1,00,000 (or its equivalent) by corporates, 
in accordance with the Master Direction on Other 
Remittance Facilities. In this context, effective 
April 12, 2023, AD Category-II entities were 
also permitted to allow online submission of 
Form A2 to improve customer convenience and 
turnaround time. 
Remittances to IFSCs under the LRS
V.40 The Reserve Bank had allowed 
remittances up to US$ 2,50,000 under LRS to 
IFSCs for making investments in securities, other 
than those issued by entities/companies resident 
in India, but outside IFSC, in February 2021. 
There were, however, certain differences in the 
features of the LRS remittance facility applicable 
to IFSCs vis-à-vis foreign jurisdictions. For 
instance, resident individuals could maintain only 
a non-interest-bearing foreign currency account 
in IFSCs and any idle funds lying in such accounts 
had to be repatriated within 15 days. On a review 
and with an objective to align the LRS for IFSCs 
vis-à-vis other foreign jurisdictions, the condition 
of repatriating any funds lying idle in the account 
beyond a period of 15 days from the date of its 
receipt was withdrawn and was aligned with the 
period applicable for such remittances to other 
foreign jurisdictions, i.e., 180 days with effect 
from April 26, 2023.V.41 Further , IFSCs are treated as foreign 
jurisdictions only for the purposes of financial 
services and, therefore, the remittances towards 
current account transactions like travel, education, 
gift, etc., or for capital account transactions 
like purchase of immovable property are not 
applicable for IFSCs. LRS remittances to IFSCs 
were permitted only for making investments 
in securities, vide circular dated February 16, 
2021. The GoI vide gazette notification dated 
May 23, 2022 has notified select courses offered 
by foreign universities/institutions in IFSC, 
as financial services. Therefore, with effect 
from June 22, 2023, remittances by resident 
individuals for payment of course fees to foreign 
universities/institutions in IFSCs have been 
enabled under LRS for the defined purpose, i.e., 
‘studies abroad’.
Levy of Charges on Forex Prepaid Cards/Store 
Value Cards/Travel Cards
V.42 A few APs have been levying charges/
fees on forex pre-paid card/store value cards, 
payable in India for services provided to 
customers in India in foreign currency (FCY). 
These transactions between the APs and the 
residents are essentially domestic transactions 
between two residents, and they should not 
result in any foreign exchange risk being borne 
by the resident. Accordingly, instructions have 
been issued advising APs that any fees/charges 
payable in India must be denominated and settled 
in INR only.
Guidelines on Import of Silver by Qualified 
Jewellers as Notified by the IFSC Authority 
(IFSCA)
V.43 Pursuant to the Directorate General of 
Foreign Trade (DGFT) notification dated October 
11, 2023, wherein qualified jewellers (as notified 

FINANCIAL MARKETS AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE MANAGEMENT111by IFSCA) are permitted to import silver under 
specific Indian Trade Classification (ITC) based 
on Harmonised System (HS) codes through India 
International Bullion Exchange IFSC Limited 
(IIBX), in addition to nominated agencies as 
notified by the Reserve Bank (in case of banks) 
and DGFT (for other agencies), AD banks have 
been permitted to allow qualified jewellers (as 
notified by IFSCA) to remit advance payment for 
11 days for import of silver through IIBX in IFSC, 
subject to specified conditions, from November 
10, 2023.
International Trade Settlement in INR - Opening  
of Additional Current Account for Exports 
Proceeds
V.44 To provide greater operational flexibility to 
the exporters, AD Category-I banks maintaining 
special rupee vostro account (SRVA) as per the 
provisions of the Reserve Bank circular dated 
July 11, 2022 are permitted to open an additional 
special current account for their exporter 
constituent exclusively for settlement of their 
export transactions, from November 17, 2023.
CIMS Project Implementation - Discontinuation 
of Submission in Legacy eXtensible Business 
Reporting Language (XBRL)
V.45 With the launch of the Reserve Bank’s 
next generation data warehouse, viz., centralised 
information management system (CIMS) on 
June 30, 2023, the submission of seven returns 
by AD Category-I banks through the XBRL site 
has been discontinued and shifted to the CIMS 
platform.
Guidelines on Import of Gold by Tariff Rate Quota 
(TRQ) Holders under the India-UAE CEPA as 
Notified by the IFSC Authority (IFSCA)
V.46 Pursuant to the DGFT notification dated 
November 20, 2023, AD banks have been 
permitted to allow valid TRQ holders under the India-UAE Comprehensive Economic 
Partnership Agreement (CEPA), as notified by 
the IFSCA, to remit advance payment for 11 
days for import of gold through IIBX against the 
TRQ, starting from January 31, 2024, subject to 
directions mentioned in A.P. (DIR Series) circular 
dated May 25, 2022.
Conducting Awareness Programmes and 
Creation of Digital Content
V.47 As part of awareness initiatives, the 
Department has been conducting workshops in 
various ROs of the Reserve Bank to supplement 
the initiative of simplification of regulations being 
carried out at the central office. In addition, the 
Department conducted workshops for APs and 
FEMA exhibition-cum-townhall events during 
the year, where trade and industry bodies and 
users of foreign exchange participated. These 
awareness programmes are also being used by 
the ROs to explain the recent policy changes and 
obtain feedback on ground-level implementation.
Delegation of Powers to AD Banks and ROs
V.48 As part of the exercise to delegate 
powers to AD banks, mainly to improve customer 
service/turnaround time and also to enable 
the Department to focus on policy issues, the 
following measures were undertaken:
 ●Keeping with the spirit of liberalisation, 
and with a view to enhancing the ease of 
doing business, late submission fee (LSF) 
concept was introduced in the Foreign 
Exchange Management (Overseas 
Investment) Regulations, 2022, 
implemented at seven identified ROs 
(viz., Ahmedabad, Bengaluru, Chennai, 
Hyderabad, Kolkata, Mumbai and New 
Delhi). Subsequently, to further streamline 
the operational procedure and to reduce 
the turnaround time for processing of LSF 

ANNUAL REPORT 2023-24112applications, the process was simplified 
by enabling online processing and online 
payment modes for collection of LSF 
amount. Accordingly, a revised version 
of the SOP has been issued for feedback 
from the seven designated ROs; and 
 ●Earlier, overseas investment transactions 
reported on the Overseas Investment 
Division’s (OID) application with delay 
required ratification from the Reserve 
Bank. With the introduction of online 
processing of LSF applications under 
OID application, powers to take such 
transactions on record have been 
delegated to AD banks, subject to payment 
of LSF, wherever applicable. The measure 
is expected to reduce the time for ratifying 
such delayed reporting and enable faster 
processing of subsequent reporting. 
Agenda for 2024-25
V.49 With a focus on achieving the milestones 
set under the Reserve Bank’s medium-
term strategy framework, the Department’s 
strategy for 2024-25 will be to consolidate and 
carry forward all the above initiatives. With 
emphasis on continuous synchronisation of the 
FEMA operating framework with the evolving 
macroeconomic environment, rationalisation 
of various guidelines will be of primary focus. 
Accordingly, the Department has finalised the 
following strategic action plan for the year 
2024-25:
 ●Review of the authorisation framework 
for APs under Foreign Exchange 
Management Act, 1999 (Utkarsh 2.0); ●Liberalisation of external commercial 
borrowing (ECB) framework;
 ●‘Go-live’ for phase I of software platform 
for ECBs and trade credits reporting and 
approval (SPECTRA) project;
 ●Rationalisation of regulations for export of 
goods and services (Utkarsh 2.0);
 ●Review of the supervisory framework of 
APs;
 ●Rationalisation of Foreign Exchange 
Management (Guarantee) Regulations;
 ●Rationalisation of Foreign Exchange 
Management (Mode of Payment and 
Reporting of Non-Debt Instruments) 
Regulations;
 ●Internationalisation of INR: 
o Permitting opening of INR account 
outside India by persons resident 
outside India (PROIs) [Utkarsh 2.0];
o INR lending by Indian banks to PROIs; 
and
o Enabling foreign direct investment 
(FDI) and portfolio investment through 
special accounts [viz., special non-
resident rupee (SNRR) and special 
rupee vostro account (SRVA)].
 ●Making a framework for a comprehensive 
integrated reporting of forex transactions; 
 ●Measures to improve the role of GIFT 
City4 at Gandhinagar, Gujarat vis-à-vis  
other international financial centres:
o Encouraging the trading of FCY-INR 
pairs, for different foreign currencies; 
and 
4 Gujarat International Finance Tec-City. 

FINANCIAL MARKETS AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE MANAGEMENT113o Review of the IFSC regulations under 
FEMA. 
 ●Review of Compounding Proceedings 
Rules, under the Foreign Exchange 
Management Act (FEMA), 1999 (Utkarsh 
2.0);
 ●Rationalisation of the LRS (Utkarsh 2.0); 
and 
 ●Rationalisation of inward remittance 
schemes, viz., MTSS and Rupee Drawing 
Arrangement (RDA) [Utkarsh 2.0].
5. CONCLUSION 
V.50 During the year, the Reserve Bank 
undertook several measures towards enhancing 
transparency in financial markets, expanding 
investor base and strengthening regulatory framework in line with evolving business 
practices and models, with an emphasis on 
easing compliance burden on regulated entities. 
The announced inclusion of Indian government 
bonds in global bond indices is expected to 
have a salutary impact on the government 
securities market in terms of enhancing liquidity, 
price discovery and diversity in participation 
base. Rationalisation of regulations towards 
promoting the internationalisation of the INR was 
undertaken to enable the settlement of bilateral 
trade in local currencies. Going forward, the 
liquidity operations would continue to be in sync 
with the stance of the monetary policy, while the 
foreign exchange operations would be guided by 
the objective of ensuring orderly movements in 
the exchange rate of the Rupee.

robust	and	resilient	during	the	year.	The	Reserve	
Bank	continued	 with	concerted	 endeavours 	
to	fortify	the	financial	 system	and	promote	
responsible	 innovations	 amidst	emerging	
challenges	 from	technological	 disruptions,	 cyber	
risks	and	climate	change.	As	part	of	the	overall	
objective	 of	aligning	the	regulatory/supervisory 	
framework	 with	global	best	practices,	 important	
strides	in	the	areas	of	risk	management,  
regulatory	 compliance	 and	enforcement,	 and	
consumer	 education	 and	protection	 were	
undertaken	during	the	year.
VI.2 	 The	Department	 of	Regulation	 (DoR)	
issued	several	guidelines	 which,	 inter alia,	
included	default	loss	guarantee	 in	digital	lending;	
framework	 for	compromise	 settlements	 and	
technical	 write-offs;	 investment	 in	alternative 	
investment	 funds;	prudential	 norms	for	
classification,	 valuation,	 operations	 of	investment 	
portfolios	 of	commercial	 banks;	and	minimum	
capital	requirements	for	operational	risk.
VI.3 	 The	FinTech	 Department	 expanded 	
the	scope	and	coverage	 of	central	bank	digital	
currency	 (CBDC)-Wholesale	 (CBDC-W)	 and	
CBDC-Retail	 (CBDC-R)	 pilots;	and	launched	 a	
pilot	project	for	public	tech	platform	for	frictionless 	
credit.VI.4 	 The	Department	 of	Supervision	 (DoS)	
initiated	a	host	of	measures	to	further	strengthen 	
both	onsite	and	offsite	supervision,	 including	
streamlining	 onsite	assessments	 of	supervised 	
entities	(SEs)	related	to	know	your	customer	
(KYC)/anti-money	 laundering	 (AML)	and	cyber/
information	 technology	 (IT)	risks;	revamping 	
stress	testing	model;	strengthening	 of	early	
warning	signal	(EWS)	and	fraud	risk	management 	
system	(FRMS);	and	strengthening	 supervisory 	
engagements	 with	SEs.	The	Consumer 	
Education	 and	Protection	 Department	 (CEPD)	
continued	 its	efforts	towards	enhancing	 customer	
protection	 and	grievance	 redress	mechanism, 	
and	harmonising	 the	instructions	 applicable	 to	the	
various	regulated	 entities	(REs)	on	the	Internal	
Ombudsman	(IO)	scheme. 	
VI.5 	 This	 chapter	 discusses	 regulatory 	
and	supervisory	 measures	 undertaken	 during	 
2023-24	to	strengthen	 the	financial	system	and	to	
preserve	financial	stability.	The	rest	of	this	chapter	
is	divided	into	five	sections.	 Section	2	deals	
with	the	mandate	and	functions	 of	the	Financial	
Stability	Department	 (FSD).	Section	3	dwells	
upon	regulatory	 measures	 undertaken	 by	the	 
DoR	along	with	activities	 of	the	FinTech	
Department.	 Section	 4	covers	supervisory 	
measures	 undertaken	 by	the	DoS	and	During 2023-24, the Reserve Bank continued with initiatives to build a resilient and sound financial system. 
Several regulatory and supervisory measures were implemented in line with global best practices towards further 
strengthening of governance, risk management practices and capital buffers. The Reserve Bank persisted with 
its efforts to leverage on technology for an effective and efficient supervision along with a focus on enhancing 
cyber security. Sustained efforts were made for further improving customer services as well as strengthening fraud 
detection mechanisms. 

REGULATION, SUPERVISION AND FINANCIAL STABILITY115enforcement	 actions	 carried	out	by	the	
Enforcement	 Department	 (EFD).	Section	5	
highlights	 the	role	played	by	CEPD	and	Deposit	
Insurance	 and	Credit	Guarantee	 Corporation 	
(DICGC)	 in	protecting	 consumer	 interests,	
spreading	 awareness	 and	upholding	 consumer 	
confidence.	 The	agenda	of	these	departments	 for	
2024-25	are	covered	in	the	respective	 sections	of	
this	chapter.	Concluding	 observations	 are	set	out	
in	the	last	section.
2. FINANCIAL STABILITY DEPARTMENT (FSD)
VI.6 	 The	mandate	 of	the	FSD	is	to	monitor	
risks	to	financial	 stability	and	evaluate	 the	
resilience	 of	the	financial	system	by	undertaking 	
macroprudential	 surveillance.	 It	also	functions	
as	the	secretariat	 of	the	Sub-Committee	 of	the	
Financial	 Stability	and	Development	 Council	
(FSDC-SC),	 an	inter-regulators’ 	institutional 	
forum	for	monitoring	 macroprudential	 regulations 	
for	the	financial	system	and	preserving	 financial	
stability.	The	FSD	is	also	mandated	 to	publish	the	
Financial	 Stability	Report	(FSR)	that	assesses	
possible	risk	scenarios	 for	financial	stability	and	
early	warning	analyses. 	
Agenda for 2023-24
VI.7 	 The	Department	 had	set	out	the	following	
goals	for	2023-24:
 •Peer	review	of	stress	testing	framework 	
(Paragraph	VI.8);
 •Conducting	 macroprudential	 surveillance 	
(Paragraph	VI.8);
 •Publishing	 half-yearly	 FSRs	(Paragraph 	
VI.9);	and
 •Conducting	 meetings	 of	the	FSDC-SC 	
(Paragraph	VI.9).Implementation Status 
VI.8		 A	peer	review	of	the	stress	testing	
framework	 was	carried	out	by	a	team	from	the	
International	 Monetary	 Fund	(IMF)	in	April	2023,	
which	submitted	 its	final	report	in	September 	
2023.	Another	IMF	technical	 assistance	 mission	
visited	the	Department	 in	January	2024	to	facilitate	
implementation	 of	the	major	recommendations	 of	
the	report.	The	Department	 also	participated	 in	
a	global	stress	testing	exercise	jointly	initiated	
by	the	Basel	Committee	 on	Banking	Supervision 	
(BCBS)	and	Financial	 Stability	Board	(FSB)	with	
representation	 from	multiple	jurisdictions.	 The	
exercise	combined	 a	common	 global	scenario	
with	a	detailed	dataset	on	various	parameters 	
of	banks	so	as	to	serve	as	a	tool	for	national	
authorities	 to	compare	 the	resilience	 of	their	
banking	systems	with	other	jurisdictions.	 In	this	
regard,	the	Department	 carried	out	stress	tests	
on	the	global	operations	 of	10	major	Indian	banks.	
For	this	purpose,	 the	Department	 developed 	
bespoke	stress	test	models	and	also	projected	
major	banking	 parameters	 for	the	period	 
2023-25.	The	salient	results,	the	methodology	 and	
assumptions	 used	for	the	exercise	were	submitted 	
to	the	Bank	for	International	Settlements	(BIS). 	
VI.9 	 Two	editions	of	the	FSR	providing	 the	
collective	 assessment	 of	the	FSDC-SC	 on	the	
balance	of	risks	to	financial	stability	and	the	
resilience	 of	the	Indian	financial	system	were	
released	 during	the	year.	During	2023-24,	 the	
FSDC-SC	 held	one	meeting,	in	which	it	reviewed	
major	global	and	domestic	 macroeconomic 	
and	financial	 developments,	 issues	in	inter-
regulatory	 coordination	 relating	to	the	Indian	
financial	sector,	activities	 of	various	technical	
groups	under	its	purview,	and	the	functioning	 of	
State	Level	Coordination	 Committees	 (SLCCs)	in	
various	states/union	 territories	 (UTs).	The	FSDC-

ANNUAL REPORT 2023-24116SC	resolved	to	remain	vigilant	against	any	build-
up	of	vulnerabilities	 in	the	Indian	financial	system	
as	well	as	the	broader	economy,	 especially 	
from	global	spillovers,	 and	to	preserve	financial	
system	stability	for	attaining	strong,	sustainable 	
and	inclusive	growth.  	
Agenda for 2024-25
VI.10 	 In	2024-25,	apart	from	its	regular	items	of	
work,	FSD	will	focus	on	the	following:
 •Implementation	 of	recommendations	 of	
the	peer	review	(Utkarsh	2.0);
 •Development	 of	a	non-banking	 stability	
map/index	(Utkarsh	2.0);	and
 •Enhancement	 of	single-factor	 stress	tests	
(Utkarsh	2.0).
3. REGULATION OF FINANCIAL 
INTERMEDIARIES
Department of Regulation (DoR)
VI.11 	 The	DoR	is	the	nodal	Department	 for	
regulation	 of	commercial	 banks,	cooperative 	
banks,	 non-banking	 financial	 companies 	
(NBFCs),	 credit	information	 companies	 (CICs)	
and	all-India	financial	institutions	 (AIFIs).	The	
regulatory	 framework	 is	fine-tuned	 as	per	the	
evolving	requirements	 of	the	Indian	economy	
while	adapting	to	international	best	practices.
Agenda for 2023-24
VI.12 	 The	Department	 had	set	out	the	following	
goals	for	2023-24:
 •Comprehensive	 review	of	instructions	 on	
statutory	 and	other	restrictions	 in	credit	
management	 (Utkarsh	 2.0)	[Paragraph 	
VI.13];
 •Review	of	miscellaneous	 non-banking 	
companies	 (MNBCs)	 regulations	 (Utkarsh  
2.0)	[Paragraph	VI.14]; •Recognition	 of	self-regulatory	 organisations 	
(SROs)	for	NBFCs	(Paragraph	VI.15);
 •Review	of	liquidity	management	 framework 	
of	UCBs	(Utkarsh	2.0)	[Paragraph	VI.16];
 •Review	of	policy	on	conduct	of	activities	
by	banks	and	NBFCs	(Paragraph	VI.17);
 •Review	of	regulation	 on	agency	business	
and	referral	service	(Paragraph	VI.17); 	
 •Issue	of	harmonised	 regulations	 on	
‘Income	Recognition,	 Asset	Classification 	
and	Provisioning	 Pertaining	 to	Advances’ 	
to	regulated	 entities	 (Utkarsh	 2.0)	
[Paragraph	VI.18];
 •Comprehensive	 review	of	all	non-
fund	based	contingent	 facilities	issued	
by	lending	institutions	 (Utkarsh	 2.0)	
[Paragraph	VI.18];
 •Review	 of	instructions	 on	various	
regulatory	 approvals	 of	UCBs	(Paragraph 	
VI.19);	
 •Comprehensive	 review	of	guidelines	 on	
area	of	operations	 of	UCBs	(Paragraph 	
VI.19);	and
 •Regulatory	 initiatives	 on	climate	risk	and	
sustainable	finance	(Paragraph	VI.20). 
Implementation Status
VI.13 	 During	the	year,	extensive	 consultations 	
were	undertaken	 with	regard	to	the	extant	
instructions	 on	statutory	 and	other	restrictions 	
in	credit	management.	 Subsequently,	 necessary 	
instructions	 were	issued	as	and	where	applicable. 	
VI.14 	 As	a	policy	stance,	the	Reserve	Bank	
has	been	discouraging	 acceptance	 of	deposits	
by	various	non-banking	 financial	 institutions 	
(NBFIs).	 As	part	of	this,	the	Reserve	 Bank	
prohibited	 deposit	acceptance	 by	MNBCs/chit 	
fund	companies,	 except	from	their	shareholders. 	

REGULATION, SUPERVISION AND FINANCIAL STABILITY117In	view	of	various	legislative	 enactments/
regulatory	 developments1	on	deposit	acceptance, 	
a	review	of	the	extant	regulatory	 framework 	
governing	 deposit	acceptance	 by	MNBCs/
chit	fund	companies	 is	being	carried	out	in	the	
Department	 in	consultation	 with	the	Government 	
of	India	and	other	stakeholders.
VI.15 	 Considering	 the	increasing	 number	
of	financial	entities	regulated	 by	the	Reserve	
Bank,	in	terms	of	scale,	customer	 outreach	and	
diversification,	 along	with	increased	 adoption	of	
innovative	 technologies	 in	delivery	of	financial	
services,	a	need	was	felt	to	promote	ethical	and	
professional	 standards	 for	orderly	development 	
of	the	financial	ecosystem.	 In	view	of	the	potential	
role	of	SROs	in	improving	 compliance	 culture	and	
providing	 consultative	 platform	for	policy	making,	
it	was	decided	to	issue	an	omnibus	framework 	
for	recognising	 SROs	for	various	REs	of	the	
Reserve	 Bank.	The	omnibus	 SRO	framework 	
prescribes	 the	broad	objectives,	 functions,	
eligibility	 criteria,	and	governance	 standards, 	
among	others,	which	will	be	common	 for	all	
SROs,	irrespective	 of	the	sector.	The	Reserve	
Bank	may	prescribe	 additional	 conditions	 for	
recognising	 sector-specific	 SROs.	A	draft	of	the	
omnibus	framework	 was	released	on	December 	
21,	2023	for	comments	 from	stakeholders, 	
following	which,	the	final	framework	 was	issued	
on	March	21,	2024.	Applications	 for	recognition 	
of	SROs	for	NBFCs	would	be	invited	henceforth.
VI.16 	 The	extant	instructions	 on	liquidity	
management	 framework	 of	UCBs	are	being	
reviewed,	 and	a	draft	Master	Direction	 on	the	
subject	is	under	examination.VI.17 	 Based	on	the	recommendations	 from	the	
internal	working	group	report	and	inputs	received	
from	other	stakeholders,	 a	circular	consolidating 	
instructions	 on	conduct	of	activities	by	banks	is	
currently	under	preparation.	 Also,	the	regulations 	
on	agency	business	and	referral	service	by	banks	
and	NBFCs	for	third	party	products	 are	under	
review.
VI.18		 Based	 on	the	inputs	received	from	the	
stakeholders,	 the	work	related	to	the	harmonisation 	
of	prudential	 norms	on	‘Income	Recognition, 	
Asset	Classification	 and	Provisioning	 pertaining 	
to	Advances’ 	is	currently	underway.	 A	review	of	
the	various	non-fund	 based	facilities	extended	
by	the	REs	is	also	underway	 with	a	view	to	
strengthen	 the	regulatory	 framework	 governing 	
such	facilities. 	
VI.19 	 The	Department	 reviewed	 and	issued	
guidelines	 in	the	following	 regulatory	 areas	of	
UCBs:	(a)	revised	criteria	regarding	 inclusion	
of	UCBs	in	the	second	schedule	 of	the	RBI	Act,	
1934;	(b)	introduction	 of	an	automatic	 route	
for	branch	expansion	 in	the	approved	 area	of	
operation	 for	financially	 sound	and	well	managed	
(FSWM)	UCBs	in	all	tiers	(except	salary	earners’	
banks);	and	(c)	guidelines	 on	change	in	the	name	
of	cooperative	 banks	and	amendment	 of	their 
bye	laws.	The	review	of	guidelines	 on	area	of	
operation	 of	UCBs	is	currently	under	examination. 	
VI.20 	 As	announced	 in	the	Reserve	 Bank’s	
Statement	 on	Developmental	 and	Regulatory 	
Policies	(February	 8,	2023),	a	framework	 for	
acceptance	 of	green	deposits	 was	issued	on	
April	11,	2023	with	an	objective	 to	encourage 	
REs	to	offer	green	deposits	to	customers,	 protect	
1 Such	as	enactment	 of	Prize	Chits	and	Money	Circulation	 Schemes	 (Banning)	 Act,	1978;	Chit	Fund	Act,	1982;	Companies	 (Acceptance	 of	
Deposits)	Rules,	2014;	and	Banning	of	Unregulated	Deposit	Schemes	 Act,	2019.

ANNUAL REPORT 2023-24118depositors’ 	interest,	address	greenwashing	 risks	
and	help	augment	 the	flow	of	credit	to	green	
activities/projects.	 On	December	 29,	2023,	a	set	
of	frequently	 asked	questions	 (FAQs)	aimed	to	
offer	clarifications	 and	address	common	queries	
related	to	the	green	deposit	framework	 were	
published	 on	the	Reserve	 Bank’s	website.	A	
draft	disclosure	 framework	 on	climate-related 	
financial	risks,	2024	was	placed	on	the	Reserve	
Bank’s	website	on	February	 28,	2024	for	public	
consultation,	 which	includes	guidelines	 to	the	
REs	for	climate-related	 financial	 disclosures 	
under	four	thematic	 pillars	–	governance, 	
strategy,	 risk	management,	 and	metrics	and	
targets.	The	framework	 aims	to	foster	an	early	
assessment	 of	climate-related	 financial	risks	and	
opportunities	 and	facilitate	 market	discipline.  
Further,	a	dedicated	 section	was	also	created	
on	the	Reserve	Bank’s	website,	containing	 the	
Reserve	Bank’s	communication	 on	climate	risk	
and	sustainable	finance.
Major Developments2
Guidelines on Default Loss Guarantee (DLG) in 
Digital Lending 
VI.21 		DLG	arrangements	 involve	 lending	
service	providers	 (LSPs)	undertaking	 to	bear	a	
certain	pre-decided	 percentage	 of	default	loss	on	
the	loan	portfolio	sourced	by	the	LSP	on	behalf	
of	the	REs.	The	primary	concern	with	respect	to	
DLG	arrangements	 entails	assumption	 of	credit	
risk	by	unregulated	 entities,	associated	 business	
conduct	issues	and	lack	of	regulatory	 oversight. 	
Notwithstanding	 these,	it	had	the	beneficial	
aspect	of	ensuring	skin-in-the-game	 for	LSPs	and	improved	 access	to	formal	credit.	An	enabling	
framework	 balancing	 the	objectives	 of	prudence	
and	innovation	 was	formulated.	 The	guidelines 	
cover	DLG	arrangements	 between	REs	and	LSPs	
as	well	as	amongst	REs	and	lay	down	several	
regulatory	 guardrails:	 (i)	cover	both	explicit	and	
implicit	DLG	arrangements;	 (ii)	limit	DLG	to	five	
per	cent	of	the	outstanding	 loan	portfolio;	(iii)	DLG	
to	be	offered	only	against	cash,	fixed	deposit	or	
bank	guarantee;	 (iv)	application	 of	guidelines 	
on	asset	classification	 and	provisioning;  
(v)	disclosure	 of	DLG	on	website	of	LSP;	and 
(vi)	enhanced	 due	diligence	by	REs	while	entering	
into/renewing	DLG	arrangements.
Framework for Compromise Settlements and 
Technical Write-offs
VI.22   The	framework	 on	compromise	 settlements 	
and	technical	 write-offs	 issued	on	June	8,	2023	
consolidates	 and	harmonises	 various	regulatory 	
guidelines	 issued	on	compromise	 settlements 	
over	the	years	in	respect	of	SCBs,	tightening 	
some	of	the	extant	regulatory	 provisions	 and	
ensures	 greater	transparency.	 In	respect	of	
other	REs,	especially	 cooperative	 banks,	the	
framework	 provides	an	enabling	mechanism	 to	
undertake	 compromise	 settlements.	 Further,	it	
lays	down	guidance	on	important	 process-related 	
matters	covering	Board	oversight,	 delegation	 of	
power,	reporting	mechanism	 and	a	cooling	period	
for	normal	cases	of	compromise	 settlements. 	
The	penal	measures	 currently	 applicable	 to	
borrowers	 classified	 as	fraud	or	wilful	defaulter	
shall	continue	to	be	applicable	 in	cases	where	
banks	enter	into	compromise	 settlements	 with	
such	borrowers.
2 This	sub	section	highlights	 the	major	circulars/guidelines	 issued	by	the	DoR.	Annex	I	of	this	Report	provides	a	comprehensive	 department-
wise	chronology	of	policy	announcements	during	 April	2023	to	March	2024.

REGULATION, SUPERVISION AND FINANCIAL STABILITY119Regulatory Measures Towards Consumer Credit 
and Bank Credit to NBFCs
VI.23 	 Post-COVID,	 credit	offtake	towards	the	
consumer	 segment	 has	been	quite	substantial 	
combined	 with	proliferating	 dependency 	
of	NBFCs	on	bank	borrowings	 leading	to	
regulatory	 concerns.	This	 warranted	 a	prudential 	
intervention,	 notwithstanding	 a	comfortable 	
asset	quality	position	at	broader	portfolio	level.	
Accordingly,	 to	pre-empt	 the	build-up	of	any	
potential	 risks,	regulatory	 measures	 were	
announced	on	November	16,	2023.
Harmonising the Provisioning Norms for Standard 
Assets to All Categories of UCBs
VI.24 	 The	provisioning	 norms	for	standard	
assets	applicable	 to	UCBs	across	all	tiers	were	
harmonised	 vide	circular	dated	April	24,	2023.	
Accordingly,	 Tier	I	UCBs,	were	permitted	 to	
achieve	the	revised	requirement	 of	0.40	per	
cent	as	standard	asset	provisioning	 vis-à-vis the 
earlier	requirement	 of	0.25	per	cent	in	a	staggered 	
manner	by	March	31,	2025.
Credit/Investment Concentration Norms – Credit 
Risk Transfer
VI.25 	 The	extant	Large	Exposure	 Framework 	
for	NBFC-upper	 layer	permits	them	to	offset	
exposures	 to	the	original	counterparty	 with	
eligible	credit	risk	transfer	instruments.	 To	ensure	
uniformity	 and	consistency	 in	computation	 of	
exposures	 across	NBFCs,	a	circular	was	issued  
on	January	 15,	2024	permitting	 NBFCs	in	
the	middle	layer	and	base	layer	to	offset	their	
exposures	 with	eligible	credit	risk	transfer	
instruments.	 Further,	NBFCs	in	the	base	layer	
are	also	required	to	put	in	place	an	internal	
Board	approved	 policy	for	credit/investment 	
concentration	 limits	for	both	single	borrower/
party	and	single	group	of	borrowers/parties.Investments in Alternative Investment Funds 
(AIFs)
VI.26 	 A	few	instances	 of	alleged	evergreening 	
were	flagged	whereby	investments	 by	REs	in	the	
AIF	schemes	 were	appropriated	 by	the	stressed	
borrowers	 of	the	concerned	 REs	for	repayment 	
of	their	loans.	To	prohibit	any	such	prudential 	
violation	 including	 evergreening,	 following	
measures	 were	initiated	on December	 19,	2023:	
(a)	REs	were	prohibited	 from	investing	in	any	of	 
the	AIF	schemes,	 which	has	downstream 	
investment	 in	any	of	the	debtor	companies	 of	
the	concerned	 RE;	(b)	REs	were	mandated 	
to	liquidate	 their	existing	investments	 in	AIFs	
within	a	stipulated	 period	of	30	days,	if	AIF	
scheme	had	invested	or	subsequently	 invests	
in	RE’s	debtor	company,	 failing	which	REs	shall	
make	full	provision	 for	their	investments	 in	that	
particular	 scheme;	and	(c)	REs	were	mandated 	
that	any	investment	 in	junior	tranche	will	be	
deducted	 in	full	from	their	regulatory	 capital	
fund.	To	ensure	consistency	 in	implementation 	
and	to	provide	further	regulatory	 guidance	 on	
some	of	the	key	issues,	clarifications	 were	
issued	on	March	27,	2024,	advising	 that:	 
(i)	downstream	 investments	 exclude	 equity	
shares	 but	include	 other	instruments;  
(ii)	provisioning	 applies	only	to	extent	of	RE’s	
investment	 in	the	AIF	scheme	(proportionate 	
basis),	and	not	on	the	entire	investment;  
(iii)	compliance	 with	paragraph	 2	of	the	circular	
dated	December	 19,	2023	is	necessary,	 if	the	
AIF	lacks	downstream	 investment	 in	a	debtor	
company;	 (iv)	proposed	 deductions	 from	capital	
affect	both	Tier-1	and	Tier-2	capital,	encompassing 	
all	forms	of	subordinated	 exposures	 including	
sponsor	 units;	and	(v)	investments	 in	AIFs	
through	intermediaries	 such	as	fund	of	funds	or	
mutual	funds	are	beyond	the	scope	of	circular.

ANNUAL REPORT 2023-24120Review of Prudential Norms for Classification, 
Valuation and Operations of Investment Portfolio 
of Commercial Banks 
VI.27 	 The	revised	Directions	 were	issued	
on	September	 12,	2023.	Some	of	the	key 
modifications	 under	the	revised	Directions	 are:	
(i)	principle-based	 classification	 of	investment 	
portfolio	into	three	categories,	 viz.,	(i)	‘Held	to	
Maturity’	(HTM),	‘Available	 for	Sale’	(AFS),	and	
‘Fair	Value	through	Profit	and	Loss	Account’	
(FVTPL);	 (ii)	clearly	identifiable	 trading	book	
under	‘Held	for	Trading’	(HFT),	a	sub-category 	
within	FVTPL;	(iii)	removal	of	the	90-day	ceiling	on	
holding	period	under	HFT	category;	 (iv)	removal	
of	ceiling	on	investments	 in	HTM	category;	
(v)	tightening	 of	regulation	 around	transfer	to/
from	HTM	category	 and	sales	out	of	HTM;  
(vi)	inclusion	of	non-statutory	 liquidity	ratio	(SLR)	
securities	 in	HTM	category,	 subject	to	fulfilling	
certain	conditions;	 (vii)	symmetric	 recognition 	
of	gains/losses	 for	investments	 under	AFS	and	
FVTPL	categories;	 and	(viii)	granular	disclosure 	
on	investment	 portfolio.	 The	revised	Directions 	
are	expected	 to	enhance	 the	quality	and	
transparency	 of	banks’	financial	reporting,	 provide	
a	fillip	to	the	corporate	 bond	market,	facilitate	the	
use	of	derivatives	 for	hedging,	 and	strengthen 	
the	overall	risk	management	 framework	 of	banks.	
While	adhering	 to	the	global	financial	reporting	
standards,	 the	Directions	 retain	important	
prudential	 safeguards	 such	as	investment 	
fluctuation	 reserve	(IFR),	due	diligence/limits	 with	
respect	to	non-SLR	investments,	 internal	control	
systems,	reviews	and	reporting.
Minimum Capital Requirements for Operational 
Risk
VI.28		 On	 June	26,	2023,	the	Reserve	Bank	
prescribed	 the	new	standardised	 approach	 for	
determining	 the	minimum	 capital	requirements 	
for	operational	 risk	in	order	to	secure	greater	convergence	 with	the	revised	Basel	standards. 	
The	new	approach	 would	replace	all	the	
approaches	 presently	 prescribed	 for	measuring 	
minimum	 operational	 risk	capital	requirements. 	
Under	the	new	standardised	 approach,	 banks	are	
required	to	consider	a	financial	statement-based 	
business	 indicator	component	 (BIC),	along	with	
loss	data-based	 internal	loss	multiplier	 (ILM)	[for	
larger	banks]	in	their	operational	 risk	regulatory 	
capital	calculation. 	
Fair Lending Practice - Penal Charges in Loan 
Accounts
VI.29 	 In	the	wake	of	divergent	practices	amongst	
the	REs	with	regard	to	levy	of	penal	interest/
charges,	the	revised	guidelines	 were	issued	which	
mandate	REs	to	formulate	a	Board	approved	policy	
on	penal	charges	and	transparently	 disclose	the	
quantum	and	reason	for	levying	of	penal	charges	
to	the	borrowers.	 Further,	penalty,	if	charged	by	
RE	for	non-compliance	 of	material	terms	and	
conditions	 of	loan	contract	by	the	borrower,	 shall	
be	in	the	form	of	‘penal	charges’	and	shall	not	be	
levied	in	the	form	of	‘penal	interest’.	REs	have	
also	been	prohibited	 from	capitalising	 the	penal	
charges,	 i.e.,	no	further	interest	shall	be	computed 	
on	such	charges.
Reset of Floating Interest Rate on Equated 
Monthly Instalments (EMI) Based Personal Loans
VI.30 	 Several	 consumer	 grievances	 related	
to	elongation	 of	loan	tenor	and/or	increase	in	
EMI	amount	without	proper	communication	 with	
and/or	consent	of	the	borrowers	 were	received.	
To	address	the	issue,	regulations	 were	issued	
to	ensure	proper	conduct	 framework	 and	
implementation	 across	REs	through	provision	 of	
adequate	 headroom	 at	origination	 for	absorbing 	
the	impact	of	rising	interest	rates,	option	of	
switching	 to	fixed	loans	and	foreclosure	 of	
loans,	transparent	 disclosure	 of	various	charges	

REGULATION, SUPERVISION AND FINANCIAL STABILITY121incidental	 to	the	exercise	of	these	options,	and	
proper	communication	 of	key	information	 to	the	
borrowers.
Responsible Lending Conduct - Release of 
Movable/Immovable Property Documents on 
Repayment/Settlement of Personal Loans
VI.31 		To	address	 the	divergent	 practices	
followed	by	REs	in	release	of	movable/immovable 	
property	documents	 after	closure	of	loan	account,	
leading	to	customer	 grievances	 and	disputes,	
regulations	 were	issued,	which	mandate	 REs	
to	release	all	the	original	movable/immovable 	
property	documents	 including	removal	of	charges	
registered	 with	any	registry	within	30	days	after	
full	repayment/settlement	 of	the	loan	account.  
The	regulations,	 inter alia,	 prescribe  
compensation	 for	delay	in	return	of	documents 	
by	REs	and	place	the	responsibility	 on	REs	
for	obtaining	 duplicate/certified	 copies	of	the	
documents	in	case	of	loss/damage. 	
Establishment of Umbrella Organisation (UO) for 
UCBs
VI.32 	 On	August	11,	2023,	the	Reserve	Bank	
granted	approval	 for	issuance	 of	certificate	 of	
registration	 (CoR)	to	National	Urban	Cooperative 	
Finance	 and	Development	 Corporation	 Ltd.	
(NUCFDC),	 the	proposed	 UO	for	UCBs,	as	a	
non-deposit	 accepting	 type-II	NBFC,	subject	to	
the	prescribed	 conditions.	 Subsequently,	 final	
CoR	was	issued	to	the	company	 on	February	 8,	
2024.
Review of Instructions on Bulk Deposits for 
Regional Rural Banks (RRBs)
VI.33 	 In	terms	of	the	extant	instructions,	 bulk	
deposits	 were	defined	as	single	rupee	term	
deposits	of	‘₹15	lakh	and	above’	for	RRBs.	On	
a	review,	the	definition	of	bulk	deposits	for	RRBs	
was	revised	to	‘₹	one	crore	and	above’	to	provide	operational	 freedom	to	RRBs	and	create	a	level	
playing	field	vis-à-vis	other	banks.
Review of Regulatory Framework for  
Infrastructure Debt Fund (IDF) - NBFCs 
VI.34 	 To	enable	the	IDF-NBFCs	 to	play	a	
greater	role	in	financing	 of	the	infrastructure 	
sector	and	to	move	towards	the	regulatory 	
objective	 of	harmonisation	 of	regulations 	
applicable	 to	various	categories	 of	NBFCs,	the	
revised	regulatory	 framework	 for	IDF-NBFCs	 was	
issued	on	August	18,	2023.	The	key	changes	in	
the	revised	framework	 include:	(i)	withdrawing 	
the	requirement	 of	a	sponsor	 for	the	IDF-
NBFCs;	(ii)	allowing	IDF-NBFCs	 to	finance	toll-
operate-transfer	 (TOT)	projects	as	direct	lenders,  
(iii)	providing	 IDF-NBFCs	 access	to	funds  
through	loan	route	under	external	commercial 	
borrowings	 (ECBs);	and	(iv)	making	tri-partite	
agreement	 optional	for	public	private	partnership 	
(PPP)	projects.
Draft Guidelines on Wilful and Large Defaulters
VI.35 	 The	draft	Master	Direction	was	placed	on	
the	Reserve	Bank’s	website	on	September	 21,	
2023.	The	proposed	Master	Direction	consolidates	
all	instructions	 on	wilful	and	large	defaulters  
along	with	other	modifications	 based	on	various	
court	Judgments	 and	representations/suggestions 	
received	from	Indian	Banks’	Association	 (IBA),	
banks	and	other	stakeholders.	 Final	guidelines 	
would	be	issued	after	examination	 of	these	
comments. 	
Strengthening of Customer Service Rendered by 
CICs and Credit Institutions (CIs)
VI.36 	 To strengthen	 customer	 service	rendered	
by	CICs	and	CIs,	a	compensation	 framework 	
has	been	prescribed	 for	non-adherence	 to	the	
timelines	 (30	days) for updation/rectification	 of	
credit	information	 by	them.	Further,	CICs	have	

ANNUAL REPORT 2023-24122been	advised	to	notify	customers	 via	short	
messaging	 service	(SMS)  or	 e-mail	regarding	
access	to	their	credit	information	 report.	To	 bring	
more	transparency	 in	the	credit	information 	
reporting	 process,  CIs	 have	been	advised	to	
notify	their	borrowers	 via SMS or	 e-mail	while	
submitting	 information	 to	CICs	regarding	 default	
or	days	past	due	in	the	existing	credit	facilities.	
In	addition,	 CIs	shall	have	a	dedicated	 nodal	
point	for	addressing	 customer	 grievances	 raised	
by	CICs,	conduct	root	cause	analysis	(RCA)	of	
customer	 grievances	 on	a	half-yearly	 basis	and	
inform	the	customers	 the	reasons	for	the	rejection	
of	their	data	correction	 request.	CICs	have	been	
advised	to	ingest	the	credit	information	 data	into	
their	database	 within	seven	days	of	receipt	from	
CIs,	disclose	the	data	of	the	complaints	 received	on	their	website,	 conduct	periodic	review	of	
their	‘search	and	match’	logic	algorithm	 and	
prominently	 display	the	link	for	accessing	 the	free	
full	credit	reports	on	their	website. 	
Display of Information Relating to Secured Assets 
Possessed by REs Under SARFAESI 3 Act, 2002
VI.37 	 REs,	which	are	secured	creditors	as	per	
the	SARFAESI	 Act,	2002,	have	been	advised	to	
display	information	 in	respect	of	the	borrowers, 	
whose	secured	assets	have	been	taken	into	
possession	 by	them	under	the	said	Act,	on	their	
website.
Public Consultations for Regulatory Measures
VI.38		 The	 Reserve	Bank	follows	a	participative 	
and	consultative	 approach	 in	the	formulation	 of	
its	policies	(Box	VI.1).
3 Securitisation	and	Reconstruction 	of	Financial	 Assets	and	Enforcement	of	Security	Interest.	
4 US	Federal	Reserve,	Bank	of	England,	Bank	of	Italy,	Monetary	 Authority	of	Singapore,	 Reserve	Bank	of	New	Zealand	and	South	African	
Reserve	Bank.	
5 RRA	2.0	was	constituted	 with	a	focus	on	enhancing	 the	ease	of	compliance	 for	the	REs	by	reviewing	 the	regulatory	 procedures.	 This	was	
a	comprehensive	exercise	involving	both	internal	as	well	as	external	consultations	at	multiple	levels.Public	consultations	 are	mechanisms	 used	by	regulatory	
authorities	 like	central	banks	to	inform	the	public	about	
regulatory	 changes	 under	consideration	 and	solicit	
their	feedback	 and	inputs.	Such	consultations	 improve	
transparency,	 efficiency	 and	effectiveness	 of	regulations	
(IMF	2000;	OECD,	2006).	An	analysis	of	the	recent	
practices	followed	by	the	major	central	banks4	indicates	that: 
(a)	The	central	banks	have	resorted	to	public	consultations	
at	various	stages	of	the	policy	formulation,	 before	release	of	
policies	or	change	in	existing	policies/regulatory	 framework;	
(b)	The	stakeholders	 are	provided	15-120	days	to	share	their	
comments	 on	the	proposals,	 often	with	a	dedicated	 web	page	
for	the	feedback;	 (c)	Comments/feedback	 received	are	often	
placed	in	the	public	domain;	and	(d)	Additional	 consultative	
channels	such	as	setting	up	of	a	Committee	 and	organising	
conferences/meetings	 in	order	to	have	greater	insights	on	
complex	and	technical	regulatory	issues	are	also	deployed.	Box VI.1
Public Consultations for Regulatory Measures by Reserve Bank of India 
Consultation Process of Reserve Bank of India 
The	Reserve	Bank	of	India	(RBI)	generally	seeks	comments/
feedback	 from	the	stakeholders/public	 on	new/major	
regulatory	 measures,	 incremental	 regulatory	 changes	in	the	
extant	guidelines 	and	comprehensive	 review	of	the	existing	
guidelines/regulations.	 The	Regulations	 Review	Authority	
2.0	(RRA	2.0)5	in	its	Report	in	2022	had	recommended	
that	“The	endeavour	 should	be	to	issue	instructions	 after	
necessary	 public	consultation	 to	the	extent	feasible	and	
draft	instructions,	 wherever	 possible,	 be	placed	in	public	
domain	and	feedback	be	sought	before	finalising	them”.
In	the	case	of	new/major	 regulatory	 measures,	 public	
consultations	 are	invariably	 undertaken	 by	the	Reserve	
Bank	by	placing	the	relevant	working	group	reports,	
discussion	 papers,	and	draft	circulars/guidelines	 on	its	
website	before	issuing	the	final	regulatory	 guidelines.	 In-
(Contd.)

REGULATION, SUPERVISION AND FINANCIAL STABILITY123house	consultations	 with	stakeholders	 are	also	undertaken	
to	gauge	their	readiness	 and	acceptability	 to	ensure	policy	
effectiveness.
Wider	consultations	 with	all	the	stakeholders	 usually	
take	place	while	comprehensively	 reviewing	 the	extant	
regulation.	 In	certain	cases,	advisory	committees	 are	set	
up	for	discussions	 and	consultations	 on	various	aspects	of	
proposed	measures/regulations.
In	response	 to	various	queries	and	ongoing	engagement	
with	stakeholders	 on	the	regulatory	 measures,	 a	mechanism	
of	issuing	frequently	 asked	questions	 (FAQs)	is	also	in	place	
for	providing	 clarifications,	 besides	ensuring	 continuous	
feedback	 from	the	public/stakeholders	 on	the	extant	
regulatory	guidelines.	
The	principal	 channel	of	public	consultations	 remains	
seeking	written	comments/feedback	 on	draft	regulatory	
policies	while	other	modes	for	public	consultations	 such	as	
discussions	 with	stakeholders	 and	setting	up	independent	
Working	Group/Committee	 are	also	used	to	have	a	holistic	
view	on	the	technical	 and	complex	 regulatory	 issues.	
The	need	for	public	consultation	 is	also	evaluated	 while	
assessing	 policy	risk	through	policy	risk	assessment	
template	as	prescribed	 by	the	Risk	Monitoring	 Department	
of	the	Reserve	Bank.	Additionally,	 public	consultations	 are	
proactively	 sought	in	the	niche	regulatory	 areas	such	as	
FinTech	regulations.Over	the	last	three	years	(2021-22	 to	2023-24),	 72	public	
consultations	 with	the	stakeholders	 were	undertaken	 by	
the	Reserve	Bank	in	areas	of	regulation	 and	supervision	
of	banks	and	NBFCs,	payment	and	settlement	 systems,	
financial	 markets,	 foreign	exchange	 management	 and	
consumer	 protection	 (Table	1	and	Annex	II).	The	comments/
feedback	 received	on	the	proposed	 regulatory	 policies	are	
analysed	 in-depth,	 and	final	guidelines	 are	issued	after	
incorporating	 suitable	modifications,	 as	appropriate.	 The	
participative	 and	consultative	 approach,	 providing	 around	
15-60	days6	for	the	feedback,	 facilitates	 in	ironing	out	any	
inconsistencies	 or	multiple	interpretations	 of	regulations	
under	review;	identifying	 potential	gaps	between	evolving	
market	practices	and	underlying	 regulations;	 and	formulating	
an	objective	assessment	 of	the	stakeholders’ 	concerns	and	
expectations.	
In	addition	to	these	specific	consultations	 on	regulatory	
issues,	the	Reserve	Bank	follows	a	consultative	 approach	
by	periodically	 interacting	 with	various	stakeholders	 on	
monetary	 policy	formulation	 and	other	issues.	With	this	
objective,	 the	Reserve	Bank	holds	detailed	interactions	
with	analysts,	 economists,	 researchers,	 financial	market	
participants,	 banks,	academic	bodies	and	research	
institutions,	 trade	and	industry	associations,	 and	several	
others	(Das,	2022).	
Overall,	public	consultations	 remain	an	integral	part	of	
the	formulation	 of	policies	to	the	Reserve	Bank	of	India,	
thereby	enhancing	 their	acceptability	 and	efficacies,	 besides	
ensuring	greater	transparency	and	inclusiveness.

ANNUAL REPORT 2023-24124Agenda for 2024-25
VI.39 	 During	 2024-25,	 the	Department	 will	
focus	on	the	following	key	deliverables:
 •Review	of	guidelines	 on	valuation	 of	
properties	 based	on	international	 best	
practices	(Utkarsh	2.0);
 •Regulatory	 framework	 for	web-aggregation 	
of	loan	products;
 •With	a	view	to	strengthen	 the	extant	
regulatory	 framework	 governing	 project	
finance	and	to	harmonise	 the	instructions 	
across	all	REs,	the	extant	prudential 	
norms	for	projects	under	implementation 	
were	reviewed,	 and	a	comprehensive 	
regulatory	 framework	 applicable	 for	all	
REs	is	proposed	to	be	issued;
 •In	January	 2023,	the	Reserve	 Bank	
released	 a	discussion	 paper	on	
securitisation	 of	stressed	assets	to	seek	
comments	 from	market	participants. 	
The	final	guidelines	 will	be	issued	after	
examining	the	stakeholders’ 	comments;
 •The	extant	regulations	 on	interest	rates	
on	advances	 vary	across	REs.	In	order	
to	harmonise	 the	same,	a	comprehensive 	
review	of	the	extant	regulatory	 instructions 	
is	underway;
 •A	discussion	 paper	on	introduction	 of	
expected	 credit	loss	(ECL)	framework 	
for	provisioning	 by	banks	was	issued	on	
January	16,	2023,	soliciting	 comments 	
from	stakeholders.	 While	comments	 on	
the	discussion	 paper	are	being	examined, 	
an	external	working	group	-	comprising	 of	
domain	experts	from	academia,	 industry	
and	select	major	banks	-	was	constituted 	
to	holistically	 examine	 and	provide	
independent	 comments	 on	some	of	the	technical	 aspects.	The	recommendations 	
of	the	working	group	would	be	duly	factored	
in	while	framing	the	draft	guidelines;
 •Delineating	 the	role	of	various	committees 	
(viz.,	Audit	Committee	 of	the	Board,	
Nomination	 and	Remuneration	 Committee, 	
and	Risk	Management	 Committee)	 in	
NBFCs	as	mentioned	 in	the	scale-based 	
regulatory	 framework	 issued	on	October	
22,	2021;	
 •Reviewing	 the	requirement	 of	obtaining	
prior	approval	 of	the	Reserve	Bank	for	
change	in	management	 of	NBFCs/housing 	
finance	companies	 (HFCs),	which	would	
result	in	change	in	more	than	30	per	cent	
of	the	directors,	 excluding	 independent 	
directors;
 •In	view	of	the	operationalisation	 of	a	new	
overseas	investment	 regime	under	Foreign	
Exchange	 Management	 (Overseas 	
Investment)	 Rules,	2022,	a	review	of	extant	
guidelines	 on	overseas	 investments	 by	
NBFCs	and	core	investment	 companies 	
shall	be	undertaken;
 •In	April	2021,	an	external	committee	 was	
set	up	by	the	Reserve	Bank	to	review	the	
existing	legal	and	regulatory	 framework 	
applicable	 to	asset	reconstruction 	
companies	 (ARCs)	 and	recommend 	
measures	 to	enhance	their	efficacy.	Major	
recommendations	 of	the	Committee	 were	
implemented	 vide	circular	dated	October	
11,	2022.	Remaining	 recommendations 	
of	the	Committee	 shall	be	examined	 and	
implemented	during	2024-25; 	
 •Standalone	 primary	 dealers	 (SPDs)	
are	placed	in	middle	layer	of	the	scale-
based	regulatory	 framework	 for	NBFCs.	
However,	 unlike	NBFCs,	the	SPDs	are	

REGULATION, SUPERVISION AND FINANCIAL STABILITY125subject	to	guidelines	 on	minimum	 capital	
requirements	 for	market	risk	in	view	of	
their	exposure	 to	government	 securities	
and	other	market	related	products	 and	
are	also	eligible	to	undertake	 various	core	
and	non-core	 activities	which	a	NBFC	is	
not	allowed	to	undertake.	 A	review	of	the	
framework	 for	market	risk	for	SPDs	would	
be	undertaken	 to	bring	about	convergence 	
with	Basel	III	standards	for	banks;	and 	
 •Connected	 lending	can	involve	moral	
hazard	issues	leading	to	compromise 	
in	pricing	and	credit	management.	 The	
extant	guidelines	 on	the	issue	are	limited	
in	scope	and	are	not	applicable	 uniformly	
to	all	REs.	As	announced	 in	the	Reserve	
Bank’s	Statement	 on	Developmental 	
and	Regulatory	 Policies	(December	 8,	
2023),	a	unified	regulatory	 framework	 on	
connected	 lending	for	all	the	REs	will	be	
put	in	place	for	which	a	draft	circular	will	
be	issued	for	public	comments.
FinTech Department
VI.40 	 The	FinTech	Department	 is	entrusted	 with	
the	responsibility	 of	fostering	 innovation	 in	the	
FinTech	ecosystem,	 while	remaining	 vigilant	and	
addressing	the	associated	risks. 	
Agenda for 2023-24
VI.41 	 The	Department	 had	set	out	the	following	
goals	for	2023-24:
 •Conducting	 further	pilots	with	various	
use	cases	in	both	CBDC-R	 and	
CBDC-W	 segments7	(Utkarsh	 2.0)	 
[Paragraph	VI.42-VI.43]; •Developing	 an	appropriate	 framework 	
for	managing	 FinTech	ecosystem	 in	the	
country	(Utkarsh	2.0)	[Paragraph	VI.44];
 •To	create	an	open,	interoperable  
integrated	 public	tech	platform	for	finance	
that	can	act	as	a	single	unified	public	
platform	which	would	facilitate	integration 	
of	data	in	a	seamless	 manner	for	lenders	
and	enable	the	delivery	of	frictionless 	
credit	(Paragraph	VI.45); 	
 •Conduct	 of	global	 hackathon  
‘HARBINGER’ 	series	(Paragraph	VI.46);
 •Bringing	 improvements	 in	the	account	
aggregator	 (AA)	technological	 ecosystem 	
to	achieve	 efficiency	 and	facilitate	 
further	growth	of	the	same	(Paragraph 	
VI.47);	and
 •Facilitating	 the	development	 of	RegTech	
tools	for	adoption	by	REs	and	exploring	
identification	 of	emerging	 SupTech	tools.	
One	of	the	cohorts	under	the	regulatory 	
sandbox	 (RS)/Hackathon	 would	include	
theme	relating	to	RegTech	 (Utkarsh	2.0)	
[Paragraph	VI.48].
Implementation Status
VI.42 	 The	pilot	in	the	CBDC-W	 (e₹-W)	
segment	 commenced	 from	November	 1,	2022	
for	settlement	 of	secondary	 market	transactions 	
in	government	 securities	 with	the	participation 	
of	select	banks.	This	pilot	is	aimed	at	reducing	
transaction	 costs	by	pre-empting	 the	need	
for	settlement	 guarantee	 infrastructure	 or	for	
collateral	to	mitigate	settlement	 risk.	The	scope	of	
7 India’s	CBDC,	the	Digital	Rupee	(e₹),	is	a	digital	form	of	its	official	currency,	introduced	 post	announcement	 in	the	Union	Budget	2022-
23.	It	is	a	legal	tender	issued	in	digital	form	by	the	Reserve	Bank,	offering	trust,	safety,	and	immediate	 settlement	 finality	in	the	digital	realm.	
CBDCs	come	in	two	broad	categories,	 CBDC-W,	 and	CBDC-R.	 CBDC-W	 is	restricted	 to	specific	users	like	financial	institutions,	 while	
CBDC-R	is	widely	accessible	to	the	public.

ANNUAL REPORT 2023-24126the	e₹-W	was	subsequently	 expanded	 to	include	
interbank	 lending	and	borrowing	 transactions 	
along	with	changes	in	technical	architecture.
VI.43 		The	pilot	in	the	CBDC-R	(e₹-R)	segment	
was	launched	 on	December	 1,	2022,	covering	
select	locations	 for	a	closed	user	group	(CUG)	
of	customers	 and	merchants.	 Users	can	make	
person-to-person	 (P2P)	and	person-to-merchant 	
(P2M)	transactions	 with	e₹-R	through	a	digital	
wallet	offered	by	participating	 banks	and	store	
the	digital	currency	in	the	wallets	on	their	mobile	
phones.	The	pilot	initially	started	with	four	banks	
and	four	cities.	Subsequently,	 it	was	expanded	 to	
15	banks	and	covered	81	locations.	 Based	on	the	
learnings	 from	the	pilot,	interoperability	 between	
unified	payments	 interface	(UPI)	and	CBDC	was	
introduced	 to	leverage	 on	the	UPI	acceptance 	
infrastructure	 to	offer	convenience	 and	seamless	
experience	 to	the	users.	Thus,	users	can	now	transact	by	scanning	 UPI	Quick	Response	 (QR)	
codes	with	their	CBDC	apps.	The	retail	pilot	is	
envisaged	 to	test	the	robustness	 of	the	entire	
process	of	Digital	Rupee	creation,	 distribution, 	
infrastructure	and	retail	usage	in	real	time. 	
VI.44 	 The	Working	Group	on	regulatory	 review	
of	FinTech	 related	activities	 constituted	 to	
undertake	 the	review	of	activities	 of	FinTechs	
and	suggest	recommendations	 for	sustainable 	
development	 of	the	FinTech	sector	in	the	country	
submitted	its	report	to	the	Reserve	Bank.
VI.45 	 The	Reserve	 Bank	announced	 the	
development	 of	a	public	tech	platform	 for	
frictionless	 credit	as	part	of	its	Statement	 on	
Developmental	 and	Regulatory	 Policies	(August	
10,	2023).	The	platform	was	conceptualised 	 
by	the	Reserve	 Bank	and	developed	 by	the	
Reserve	Bank	Innovation	 Hub	(RBIH)	[Box	VI.2].	
The	digital	 kisan	credit	card	(KCC)	and	digital	dairy	
loan	pilot	projects	 conducted	 in	2022	demonstrated 	 
significant	 reduction	 in	the	turnaround	 time	(TAT)	and	
brought	intended	 efficiency	 in	the	loan	processing.	 It,	
however,	also	led	to	identification	 of	various	challenges	 and	
complexities	 in	scaling	up	end-to-end	 digitalisation	 of	credit	
assessment	 and	delivery.	The	complexities	 underscored 	
the	need	for	a	platform	type	architecture,	 which	would	
enable	lenders	to	create	a	frictionless	 loan	journey	 
without	the	need	for	multiple	bespoke	integrations.	 Based	
on	these	insights	and	with	an	objective	 to	bring	efficiency	
in	terms	of	cost	reduction,	 quicker	disbursement,	 and	
scalability	 to	all	segments	 of	loan	beyond	KCC	and	dairy	
loans,	where	rule-based	 lending	is	possible,	a	public	tech	
platform	for	frictionless	 credit	(PTPFC)	 was	accordingly 	
developed. 	
The	platform	is	an	enterprise-grade	 open	architecture 	
information	 technology	 (IT)	platform,	 central	to	the	
operations	 of	a	large	ecosystem	 of	credit,	to	ensure	Box VI.2
Public Tech Platform for Frictionless Credit (PTPFC)
digital	access	to	information	 from	various	data	sources.	
The	financial	service	and	multiple	data	service	providers	
converge	 on	the	platform	using	standard	 and	protocol	
driven	architecture,	 in	an	open	and	shared	application 	
programming	 interface	 (API)	framework.	 The	friction	in	
the	credit	processing	 and	delivery	has	been	addressed	 by	
breaking	the	silo	between	the	data	repository	 by	integrating 	
them	with	the	platform	and	making	the	same	available	 to	
the	lenders	as	a	plug	and	play	service.	This	has	obviated	
the	need	of	cumbersome	 one-to-one	 integration	 of	lenders	
with	multiple	data	providers	 and	has	brought	efficiency	 to	
both	consumers	 and	lenders.	The	lenders	in	turn	need	
to	connect	only	to	the	platform	to	source	multiple	data/
information	 required	for	making	credit	assessment	 and	
decision	in	a	seamless	manner.
The	platform	is	beneficial	 to	all	stakeholders,	 including	
consumers,	 lenders	and	data	service	providers.	 Consumers 	
can	get	frictionless	 tailored	credit	by	unlocking	 value	of	
digitally	available	 data	with	trusted	consent	architecture 	
(Contd.)

REGULATION, SUPERVISION AND FINANCIAL STABILITY127The	pilot	of	the	platform	 commenced	 from	
August	17,	2023,	which	will	be	expanded 	
based	on	learnings	 and	feedback	 received	from	
stakeholders.
VI.46 	 The	Reserve	Bank	conducted	 the	second	
edition	of	the	global	hackathon	 ‘HARBINGER  
2023  -	 Innovation	 for	Transformation’ 	with	
the	theme	‘Inclusive	 Digital	Services’.	 The	
Hackathon	 featured	 four	problem	statements, 	
viz.,	(i)	innovative,	 easy-to-use,	 digital	banking	
services	 for	differently-abled	 (Divyaang);	 (ii)	
RegTech	 solutions	 to	facilitate	 more	efficient	
compliance	 for	REs;	(iii)	exploring	 use	cases/
solutions	 for	CBDC-R	 transactions,	 including	
transactions	 in	offline	mode;	and	(iv)	increasing 	
transactions	 per	second	 (TPS)/throughput 	
and	scalability	 of	blockchains.	 The	Hackathon 	
received	 encouraging	 participation	 from	within	
as	well	as	outside	India.	The	Hackathon	 ran	in	
three	phases,	starting	with	shortlisting,	 solution	
development,	 followed	by	the	final	evaluation. 	
An	independent	 jury	evaluated	 and	selected	the	
winners	and	runners-up	 out	of	28	finalist	teams	
based	on	parameters	 like	innovation,	 technology, 	
demonstration,	 user	experience,	 security,	and	
ease	of	implementation.	 These	innovative 	products	are	expected	 to	make	digital	financial	
services	more	accessible,	 efficient,	 compliant, 	
robust	and	scalable.
VI.47 	 The	Reserve	Bank	in	consultation	 with	
Reserve	Bank	Information	 Technology	 Private	Ltd.	
(ReBIT),	a	wholly	owned	subsidiary	 of	the	Reserve	
Bank,	and	other	stakeholders	 carried	out	a	major	
upgradation	 of	the	API	specification	 version	1.1.3.	
The	upgraded	 API	specification	 version	2.0.0	was	
released	 by	the	ReBIT	on	August	9,	2023	for	
adoption	by	all	participants	 of	the	AA	ecosystem. 	
The	upgradation	 addresses	 issues	such	as	
potential	 security	concerns	 and	compatibility 	
challenges	 while	sharing	financial	information. 	
In	order	to	ensure	that	the	API	specification 	
version	2.0.0	is	adopted	by	all	participants	 in	a	
smooth	and	timely	manner,	without	disrupting	 the	
functioning	 of	AA	framework,	 an	‘API	Specification 	
Adoption	 Strategy’	has	been	made	available	 on	
ReBIT’s	website.	Further,	to	reduce	the	consent	
rejection	requests	in	the	AA	framework,	 the	‘PAN	
and	e-mail’	fields	which	were	erstwhile	mandatory 	
were	made	optional	for	sharing	of	customer’s	 data	
over	the	AA	framework.	 The	updated	financial	
information	 (FI)	type	schemas	 were	released	on	
the	website	of	ReBIT.without	the	need	for	paper-based	 documentation	 or	
physical	visit	to	financial	institutions	 (banks/non-banks). 	
The	lenders	and	data	service	providers	 benefit	due	to	
network	effect,	standardisation,	 efficiency	 in	terms	of	cost	
and	TAT,	innovation	 in	lending	process,	 scalability	 and	
increasing	reach/access.
As	on	March	31,	2024,	the	platform	has	five	loan	journeys,	
viz.,	(a)	KCC	loans	up	to	₹1.6	lakh;	(b)	dairy	loans;	(c)	micro,	small,	and	medium	enterprise	 (MSME)	loans	(unsecured); 	
(d)	personal	loans;	and	(e)	home	loans,	with	a	total	of	12	
banks	participating	 in	the	pilot,	which	commenced	 from	
August	17,	2023.	The	platform	currently	enables	linkage	
with	31	different	data	services8.	Based	on	the	learnings	
and	the	positive	response	 from	the	stakeholders,	 the	scope	
and	coverage	 of	the	platform	is	being	expanded	 to	include	
more	products,	data	providers	and	lenders.

TechSprint	 contained	 two	problem	statements 	
focused	on	developing	 RegTech	tools	for	verifying	
the	environmental,	 social	and	governance	 (ESG)	
claims	and	identifying	 instances	 of	Greenwashing. 	
One	of	the	applicants	 mentored	 by	the	Reserve	
Bank	won	the	‘Fast	Solution’	award	in	the	
TechSprint.
Major Initiatives 
India’s G20 Presidency
VI.49 	 Under	the	G20	initiatives,	 the	Department

(e)	launching	 the	4th	edition	of	the	G20	TechSprint9 
under	India’s	G20	Presidency,	 with	the	theme	
‘Technology	 Solutions	 for	Cross-Border	 Payment	
Platforms’.	 The	independent	 panel	of	judges	
comprising	 domain	 experts	 selected	 one	
team	each	as	the	winner	for	the	three	problem	
statements.
Regulatory Sandbox (RS) - Cohorts
VI.50 		Under	the	third	cohort	of	the	RS	on	theme	
‘MSME	Lending’,	 five	entities	were	found	viable	
within	the	boundary	 conditions	 defined	during	
testing	under	RS.	Under	the	fourth	cohort	with	
the	theme	‘Prevention	 and	Mitigation	 of	Financial	
Frauds’,	six	entities	were	shortlisted	 for	the	test	
phase	and	the	entities	completed	 the	testing	on	
December	 31,	2023.	The	Reserve	Bank	opened	
the	fifth	cohort	which	was	‘Theme	Neutral’,	
i.e.,	innovative	 products/services/technologies 	
cutting	across	various	functions	 in	the	Reserve	
Bank’s	regulatory	 domain	were	eligible	to	apply.	
The	applications	 received	under	this	cohort	are	
currently	 under	assessment	 for	shortlisting	 for	
testing	phase.
VI.51 	 The	‘On	Tap’	application	 facility	under	RS	
is	currently	open	for	themes	‘Retail	Payments’, 	
‘Cross-Border	 Payments’ 	and	‘MSME	Lending’.	
Till	now	three	entities	have	been	selected	for	
the	test	phase	under	the	‘On	Tap’	application 	
9 The	TechSprint	 invited	global	innovators	 to	help	develop	technology	 solutions	for	cross-border	 payments	 across	three	problem	statements,	
viz.,	(i)	Anti-Money	 Laundering/Combating	 the	Financing	 of	Terrorism (AML/CFT)	 technology	 solutions	to	reduce	illicit	finance	risk;	(ii)	Foreign	
exchange	 and	liquidity	technology	 solutions	to	enable	settlement	 in	more	emerging	 market	and	developing	 economy	(EMDE)	currencies;	 and

Account Aggregator (AA) Framework
VI.52 		The	AA	framework	 is	gaining	traction	
with	increased	 participation	 of	NBFC-AAs	 and	
REs	belonging	 to	financial	 sector	regulators 	
(FSRs)	as	financial	information	 providers	 (FIPs)	
and	financial	information	 users	(FIUs).	In	order	
to	ensure	seamless	 flow	of	customer’s	 financial	
information	 from	the	FIPs,	ReBIT	has	released	the	
FI	type	schemas,	 in	consultation	 with	the	sectoral	
regulators	 and	the	Reserve	Bank.	Further,	the	
Reserve	Bank	has	adopted	a	well-considered 	
and	nuanced	 approach	 in	consultation	 with	
other	stakeholders	 to	make	the	ecosystem	 more	
robust,	technologically	 sound	and	provide	further	
fillip	to	the	 AA	framework. 	
Projects Undertaken Through RBIH
VI.53 	 During	2023-24,	the	ongoing	pilot	projects	
for	end-to-end	 digitalisation	 of	KCC	lending	have	
been	scaled	up	further	to	include	four	more	states	
(Andhra	Pradesh,	 Odisha,	and	select	districts	
of	Uttar	Pradesh	and	Maharashtra,	 apart	from	
Tamil	Nadu,	Madhya	Pradesh	and	Karnataka) 	
and	seven	banks.	The	PTPFC	project,	which	was	
operationalised	 by	the	RBIH,	commenced	 the	
pilot	from	August	17,	2023.	Since	then,	banks	
have	disbursed	 loans	of	₹5,535	crore	(including	
MSME	loans	of	₹3,640	crore)	as	on	March	31,	
2024.
Agenda for 2024-25
VI.54 		In	2024-25,	the	Department	 will	focus	on	
the	following	goals: 	
 ●Expanding	 the	scope	of	CBDC	pilots	
to	cover	new	use	cases	such	as	offline	functionality,	 programmability,	 cross-
border	transactions	 and	tokenisation 	
of	assets	as	well	as	new	designs,	
technological	 considerations	 and	more	
participants;
 ●Exploring	 commencing	 CBDC	pilots	on	
cross-border	 payments	 both	on	bilateral	
and	multilateral	 basis	to	overcome	 key	
challenges	 related	to	TAT,	efficiency	 and	
transparency,	 considering	 India	being	the	
world’s	largest	recipient	 of	remittances 	
(Utkarsh	2.0);
 ●Launching	 full	scale	public	tech	
platform with	 more	financial	institutions/
data	service	providers	 and	product	
offerings;
 ●Putting	in	place	the	framework	 recognising 	
SRO(s)	for	the	FinTech	sector	for	its	
orderly	growth	(Utkarsh	2.0);
 ●Setting	up	a	repository	 for	capturing	
essential	 information	 about	FinTechs	 and	
repository	 for	tech-related	 activities	in	order	
to	effectively	 discern	the	developments	 in	
its	ecosystem;
 ●Conduct	 of	next	global	hackathon 	
‘HARBINGER	2024’;
 ●Testing	innovative	 products/services	 and	
technology	 under	sixth	cohort	of	the	RS;	
and
 ●Identification	 of	SupTech/RegTech	 tools	
and	carrying	out	proof	of	concept10	and	a

ANNUAL REPORT 2023-241304. SUPERVISION OF FINANCIAL 
INTERMEDIARIES
Department of Supervision (DoS)
VI.55 		The	DoS	is	entrusted	with	the	responsibility 	
of	supervising	 all	SCBs	(excluding	 RRBs),	Local	
Area	Banks	(LABs),	Payments	 Banks	(PBs),	
Small	Finance	Banks	(SFBs),	CICs,	AIFIs,	UCBs,	
NBFCs	(excluding	HFCs)	and	 ARCs.
Commercial Banks 
VI.56 	 The	Department	 took	several	measures 	
to	further	strengthen	 both	onsite	and	offsite	
supervision	during	the	year.
Agenda for 2023-24 
VI.57 	 The	Department	 had	set	out	the	following	
goals	for	2023-24:
•	 Market	risk	-	conducting	 scenario	analysis	
and	providing	 an	input	for	system	stress	
test	(Utkarsh 2.0)	[Paragraph	VI.58];
•	 Implementation	 of	a	fraud	vulnerability 	
matrix	using	machine	 learning	 (ML)	
capabilities	 for	SCBs	(Utkarsh 2.0) 
[Paragraph	VI.59];	and
•	 Strengthening	 and	enhancement	 of	EWS	
and	FRMS	(Paragraph	VI.59).
Implementation Status 
VI.58		 Market	 risk	assessment	 for	primary	
dealers	(PDs),	public	sector	banks	(PSBs),	private	
sector	banks	(PVBs)	and	foreign	banks	(FBs)	was	
completed.	 The	detailed	methodology	 has	been	
devised	and	put	in	place	to	assess	the	interest	
rate	risk	under	different	stress	testing	scenarios	
and	provide	supervisory	 inputs	on	an	ongoing	
basis.
VI.59 	 A	model	construct	 for	fraud	vulnerability 	
index	(FVI)	was	prepared.	 Proof	of	concept	was	carried	out	for	a	sample	of	SCBs	and	validation	
of	the	model	was	carried	out.	FVI	model	shall	
be	implemented	 for	all	SCBs.	The	guidelines 	
pertaining	 to	EWS	and	red	flagging	of	accounts	
(RFA)	are	being	strengthened	 further	to	make	
these	robust,	effective	and	technology	driven. 	
Other Initiatives
Introduction of Control Gap Assessment under 
Supervisory Assessment of KYC/AML Risks 
(SAKAR) Framework
VI.60 	 To	assess	the	KYC/AML 	risks	in	SCBs	
in	a	comprehensive	 manner,	 a	structured 	
assessment	 of	the	controls	and	processes	 put	in	
place	by	banks	has	been	introduced	 to	identify	
the	gaps,	if	any.	The	assessment	 is	being	carried	
out	through	specifically	 designed	 templates	 and	
is	integrated	 with	the	prudential	 risk	assessment 	
process.	With	this,	a	holistic	view	of	the	KYC/
AML	risks	at	the	SEs	will	be	facilitated,	 as	the	
inherent	risk	assessment	 through	the	data-driven 	
analytical	 model	will	be	supplemented	 by	a	
focused	supervisory	 assessment	 of	the	control/
risk	mitigating	framework	at	the	entity	level. 	
Cross-Border Supervisory Cooperation
VI.61 	 In	line	with	the	BCBS	principles	 on	cross-
border	supervisory	 cooperation,	 the	Reserve	
Bank	continued	 to	have	engagements	 with	
overseas	 counterpart	 supervisors.	 The	Reserve	
Bank	hosted	the	25th	South	East	Asian	Central	
Banks-Financial	 Stability	Institute	(SEACEN-FSI) 	
Conference	 of	the	Directors	 of	Supervision	 of	
Asia-Pacific	 Economies	 and	36th	Meeting	of	the	
Directors	 of	Supervision	 of	SEACEN	 members	
at	Mumbai.	 The	Reserve	Bank	also	hosted	a	
delegation	 of	Bangladesh	 Bank	for	a	study	visit	
cum	workshop	 on	risk-based	 supervision	 at	
Mumbai.	

REGULATION, SUPERVISION AND FINANCIAL STABILITY131VI.62 	 During	 the	year,	the	Reserve	 Bank	
conducted	 supervisory	 college	meetings	of	select	
banks	and	held	seven	meetings	 with	overseas	
supervisors	 for	exchange	 of	information	 on	
supervisory	 concerns,	 methodologies	 and	best	
practices.	 The	Reserve	Bank,	in	turn,	participated 	
in	seven	supervisory	 colleges	meetings	for	select	
banks	held	by	overseas	 supervisors	 as	the	host	
authority.	 Representatives	 from	the	Reserve	
Bank	attended	 respective	 workshops	 by	the	
European	 Central	Bank	(ECB)	and	the	Hong	
Kong	Monetary	Authority	(HKMA)	on	‘Supervisory 	
Approach,	Methodology	and	Practices’.
Revamping Stress Testing Model
VI.63 		The	single-factor	 stress	testing	model	for	
SCBs	has	been	substituted	 by	a	multi-factor	 model	
of	stress	testing,	which	includes	macroeconomic 	factors	like	inflation,	GDP	growth,	exchange	 rate	
and	unemployment	 rate,	supplemented	 by	SCB	
specific	idiosyncrasies	 to	ensure	that	asset	quality	
and	capital	to	risk-weighted	 assets	ratio	(CRAR)	
positions	are	in	sync	with	macroeconomic	 factors	
as	well	as	institution	specific	features.
Strengthening Governance in Banks
VI.64 	 The	supervisory	 initiatives	 taken	by	the	
Reserve	Bank	are	aimed	at	identifying	 risks	and	
vulnerabilities	 early,	putting	in	place	a	structured 	
early	supervisory	 intervention	 framework	 to	
mitigate	the	risks,	increasing	 the	focus	on	root	
cause	of	vulnerabilities,	 and	harmonising	 the	
supervisory	 rigour	across	various	segments	 of	
the	financial	system.	In	this	regard,	strengthening 	
governance	 in	banks	remains	a	supervisory 	
priority	for	the	Reserve	Bank	(Box	VI.3).
One	of	the	focus	areas	in	recent	years	has	been	to	
strengthen	 governance	 practices	 within	the	SEs.	This	
aspect	is	not	only	examined	 during	the	onsite	supervisory 	
process	but	is	also	emphasised	 through	continuous 	
engagements	 with	the	SEs	in	the	form	of	conferences 	
and	meetings	 with	the	Board/Senior	 Management,	 and	
through	offsite	system	level	assessments.	 Banks,	as	
the	most	significant	 providers	 of	credit,	differ	from	other	
entities	as	their	collapse	 has	wider	ramifications	 for	
depositors,	 institutions,	 and	the	financial	system	itself.	 
This	makes	it	imperative	 to	subject	banks	to	specific	
regulations	 and	close	monitoring.	 Banks	are	expected	 to	
have	proper	policies	in	place	and	suitable	internal	controls	
so	that	the	governance	 structure	 is	well	implemented	 as	
banks	act	as	fulcrum	to	the	financial	structure	 and	the	
economy.	
It	is	imperative	 that	banks	have	robust	governance 	
policies	and	processes	 encompassing	 strategic	direction,	
group	and	organisational	 structure,	 control	environment, 	Box VI.3
Governance Practices in PSBs and PVBs
responsibilities	 of	the	Boards	and	Senior	Management, 	
commensurate	 with	the	risk	profile	and	systemic	
importance	 of	the	bank.	The	Boards	have	the	responsibility 	
of	approving	 and	overseeing	 implementation	 of	the	
bank’s	strategic	plan;	risk	appetite	and	related	policies;	
establishing	 and	communicating	 corporate	 culture	and	
values;	and	laying	down	policy	related	to	conflict	of	interest	
and	a	strong	control	environment. 	
During	the	supervisory	 assessment,	 the	above	aspects	
and	implementation	 of	policies	are	examined.	 These	cover	
availability	 of	adequate	 number	of	Board	members	 with	
appropriate	 skills	and	expertise	 and	effective	conduct	of	
Board	meetings	 in	accordance	 with	laid	down	policies,	
among	other	aspects.	 Sound	governance	 practices	 in	
PSBs	and	PVBs	help	in	providing	 confidence	 to	various		
stakeholders,	 particularly	 the	depositors	 who	do	not	have	a	
say	in	the	banks’	business	decisions.	 This	requires	deeper	
involvement	 of	the	Boards	of	banks	in	strategic	issues	and	
risk	oversight. 	

ANNUAL REPORT 2023-24132Fraud Analysis
VI.65 	 An	assessment	 of	bank	group-wise 	
fraud	cases	over	the	last	three	years	indicates	
that	while	private	sector	banks	reported	
maximum	 number	of	frauds,	public	sector	banks	
continued	 to	contribute	 maximum	 to	the	fraud	
amount	(Table	VI.1).	Frauds	have	occurred	
predominantly	 in	the	category	of	digital	payments 	
(card/internet),	 in	terms	of	number.	In	terms	of	
value,	frauds	have	been	reported	primarily	in	the	
loan	portfolio	(advances	 category)	 [Table	VI.2].	
There	was	a	46.7	per	cent	decline	in	the	amount	
involved	in	the	total	frauds	reported	during	2023-
24	over	2022-23.	While	small	value	card/internet 	frauds	contributed	 maximum	 to	the	number	of	
frauds	reported	by	the	private	sector	banks,	the	
frauds	in	public	sector	banks	were	mainly	in	loan	
portfolio.	
VI.66 		An	analysis	 of	the	vintage	of	frauds	
reported	 during	2022-23	 and	2023-24	 shows	
a	significant	 time-lag	 between	 the	date	of	
occurrence	 of	a	fraud	and	its	detection	(Table	VI.3).	
The	amount	involved	in	frauds	that	occurred	in	
previous	financial	years	formed	94.0	per	cent	of	
the	frauds	reported	in	2022-23	in	terms	of	value.	
Similarly,	 89.2	per	cent	of	the	frauds	reported	in	
2023-24	by	value	occurred	in	previous	financial	
years.

REGULATION, SUPERVISION AND FINANCIAL STABILITY135Implementation Status
VI.75 		During	 the	year,	the	Department 	
took	several	initiatives	 for	strengthening	 the	 
supervision	 of	NBFCs.	 The	process	 for	
cancellation	 of	certificate	 of	registration	 was	
suitably	streamlined.	 The	regional	offices	of	
Reserve	Bank	are	initiating	necessary	 action	as	
per	the	revised	process.
VI.76 	 The	impact	of	new	asset	classification 	
norms	on	the	gross	non-performing	 assets	
(GNPAs)	 reported	 by	NBFCs12	was	analysed.	
GNPAs	of	the	NBFC	sector	decreased	 from	6.3	
per	cent	of	gross	advances	 as	on	March	31,	
2022	to	5.9	per	cent	as	on	September	 30,	2022,	
which	was	the	cut-off	date	for	implementation 	
of	the	new	norms.	GNPAs	decreased	 to	5.0	per	
cent	of	gross	advances	 as	on	March	31,	2023,	
and	further	to	4.6	per	cent	as	on	September	 30,	
2023.	Since	the	system	of	marking	of	days	past	
due	on	a	daily	basis	was	already	implemented	 by	
the	larger	NBFCs,	the	new	norms	did	not	have	a	
major	impact	on	the	reported	asset	quality.	The	
increase	in	gross	advances	 of	the	NBFC	sector	
by	15.9	per	cent	during	2022-23	also	had	a	
mitigating	impact	on	the	GNPA 	level.
Other Initiatives
Scale-Based Regulatory Framework for NBFCs
VI.77 	 An	assessment	 on	identification	 of	
NBFCs	in	upper	layer,	based	on	the	methodology 	
indicated	in	the	scale-based	 regulatory	 framework 	
for	NBFCs	dated	October	22,	2021,	was	taken	
up	during	2023-24.	 The	assessment	 covered	
top	10	NBFCs	based	on	asset	size	and	sample	
of	50	NBFCs	based	on	total	exposure.	 Post	
assessment,	 15	companies	 were	identified	 for	
classification	in	NBFC-upper	layer. 	Extension of PCA Framework to Government 
NBFCs
VI.78		The	Reserve	 Bank	introduced	 PCA	
framework	 for	NBFCs	on	December	 14,	2021.	
The	framework	 was	reviewed	 and	extended	
to	government	 NBFCs	(except	those	in	base	
layer)	and	it	would	be	applicable	 with	effect	from	
October	1,	2024.
Agenda for 2024-25
VI.79 	 The	Department	 has	identified	 the	
following	 goal	for	supervision	 of	NBFCs	in	
2024-25:
 •Assessment	 of	impact	of	enhanced	 risk	
weights	prescribed	 vide	circular	dated

in	which	the	supervision	 of	banks,	UCBs	and	
NBFCs	is	being	undertaken	 in	a	holistic	manner	
under	one	umbrella	Department. 
Agenda for 2023-24 
VI.81		 The	 Department	 had	set	out	the	following	
supervisory	goals	for	all	SEs	in	2023-24:
 •A	comprehensive	 review	of	supervisory 	
processes,	 including	 that	for	rating	
models,	based	on	internal	and	external	
inputs	(Utkarsh	2.0)	[Paragraph	VI.82];
 •Calibrated	 harmonisation	 of	the	
supervisory	 approach	 across	segments/
SEs	(especially	 for	NBFCs	and	UCBs	in	
line	with	SCBs)	by	phased	introduction 	
12 The	analysis	is	based	on	data	for	deposit	taking	and	non-deposit	taking	systemically	important	NBFCs	(including	PDs)	and	CICs.

 •Strengthening	 of	cyber	security	across	
SEs	including	 setting-up	 of	cyber	range	
for	conducting	 cyber	drill,	examining 	
feasibility	 of	implementing	 Cyber	Sectoral

conducting	 phishing	simulation	 exercises	
for	SEs	(Paragraph	VI.85).
Implementation Status 
VI.82		 A	comprehensive	 review	of	supervisory 	
rating	models	was	completed.	 Revised	models	
based	on	the	review	were	rolled	out	during	the	
year.	A	calibrated	 harmonisation	 of	supervisory 	
processes	 was	undertaken	 across	SE	segments 	
(especially	 for	NBFCs	and	UCBs	in	line	with	
SCBs),	which	led	to	phased	introduction	 of	
process	audit	and	compliance	 testing	framework 	
for	UCBs	and	NBFCs.
VI.83		 Various	 measures	 were	undertaken	 to	
strengthen	 the	onsite	assessment	 mechanism	 of	
KYC/AML 	and	IT/cyber	risk	supervision:
 •The	format	of	onsite	examination	 report	
was	suitably	modified	 to	highlight	 key	
KYC/AML 	and	IT	risks	both	to	the	Senior	
Management	 of	banks	as	well	as	internal	
stakeholders	in	the	Reserve	Bank; •Greater	emphasis	 was	laid	on	generating 	
actionable	 insights	from	risks	captured	
in	offsite	returns	for	IT	supervision.	 The	
offsite	returns	were	used	as	preliminary 	
inputs	to	perform	a	focused	onsite	IT	
examination,	 which	was	supplemented 	
by	comprehensive	 onsite	assessment 	
of	banks	based	on	risk	perception	 and	
analysis;	and
 •Cyber	security	augmentation	 plan	(CSAP)	
was	issued	to	banks	highlighting	 major	
gaps	observed	 in	IT	examinations	 with	
specific	timelines.	 Half-yearly	 compliance 	
assessment	 was	conducted	 and	outlier	
SEs	were	suitably	advised	to	expedite	
compliance. 	
VI.84		 The	 Reserve	 Bank	aims	to	generate	
a	holistic	view	of	SEs	across	risk	domains	by	
effectively	 scaling/integrating	 the	data	collection	
and	analytical	 functions	 with	an	objective	 of	
standardising	 the	risk	assessment	 process.	To	
this	end,	use	cases	were	identified	 in	the	areas	
of	customer	 conduct,	 KYC/AML,	 governance 	
effectiveness,	 and	related	party	transactions, 	
which	are	being	developed	using	ML 	models.	
VI.85		 During	 the	year,	the	Department 	
undertook	 several	initiatives	 for	strengthening	 the	
cyber	security	preparedness	 of	SEs,	including	
initiating	process	of	setting-up	 of	cyber	range	for	 
conducting	 cyber	drill,	examining	 feasibility	 of	
implementing	 S-SOC	and	conducting	 phishing	
simulation	 exercises	 for	SEs.	The	cyber	
reconnaissance	 exercise	for	the	first	year	has	
been	completed	 for	public	facing	applications13 of

ANNUAL REPORT 2023-24138Supervisory	 engagement	 with	SEs	follows	 the	
broad	principles	 of	relevance,	 transparency,	 clarity,	
comprehensiveness	 and	timeliness.	 Over	the	years,	the	
domain	of	engagement	 with	SEs	has	enhanced	 significantly 	
both	in	terms	of	interaction	 level	and	frequency.	 The	
supervisory	 approach	 of	the	Reserve	 Bank	has	been	
constantly	 evolving	to	embrace	the	changing	realities	in	the	
banking	and	financial	sector.	Resultantly,	 the	contours	of	 
the	supervisory	 engagements	 with	the	SEs	have	been	
evolving	 constantly,	 moving	beyond	 the	traditional 	
approaches	as	detailed	below:
Constant Evaluation of the Governance Framework in SEs
As	governance	 is	of	paramount	 importance	 and	invariably	
at	the	root	cause	of	supervisory	 concerns,	 the	Reserve	
Bank	has	reoriented	 its	engagement	 with	the	Management 	
and	Directors	 of	the	SEs.	During	the	year,	conferences 	
were	held	for	the	Directors	 on	the	Boards	of	PSBs,	PVBs	
and	tier	3,	4	UCBs	with	the	theme	of	‘Governance	 in	
Banks	-	Driving	Sustainable	 Growth	and	Stability’,	 which	
were	attended	 by	the	Governor	 and	top	management	 of	
the	Reserve	 Bank.	Governor	 also	held	meetings	 with	
Managing	 Directors	 (MDs)	and	Chief	Executive	 Officers	
(CEOs)	of	PSBs,	PVBs,	upper	layer	(including	 HFCs)	and	
select	government	 NBFCs,	heads	of	federations	 of	UCBs	
of	states	and	CEOs	of	UCBs.	Periodic	conferences	 are	also	Box VI.5
Changing Contours of Supervisory Engagements with SEs
organised	 for	the	Reserve	Bank	Nominee	 Directors	 (ND)	
and	Additional	 Directors	(AD).	In	these	meetings,	 SEs	were	
encouraged	 to	further	strengthen	 the	governance	 structure	
to	enable	early	identification	and	mitigation	of	risks.
Meetings with Outlier SEs  
The	realm	of	analysis	in	offsite	assessment	 was	enhanced 	
to	identify	the	incipient	 and	emerging	 vulnerabilities 	
amongst	banks	and	non-banks,	 and	sectoral	stress	events.	
For	the	purpose,	advanced	 technology	 and	data	analytics	
are	being	leveraged	 to	facilitate	data-driven	 decisions, 	
identify	risks,	and	take	timely	actions	to	safeguard	 financial	
stability.	Further,	close	examination	 of	the	business	models	
of	SEs	and	meticulous	 assessment	 regarding	 its	alignment 	
with	the	stated	risk	appetite	is	also	being	undertaken. 	
The	Reserve	 Bank’s	top	management	 holds	meetings	
with	SEs	identified	 as	outliers	in	the	above-mentioned 	
assessments. 	
Assurance Functionaries  
As	assurance	 functions	 of	the	SEs	act	as	extended	
supervisory	 arms	of	the	Reserve	Bank,	strengthening	 of	
the	internal	assurance	 functions	 has	been	a	supervisory 	
priority	in	the	recent	years.	During	the	year,	a	conference 	
was	organised	 for	the	assurance	 functionaries	 of	defined	outcomes	 known	as	‘immediate	 outcomes’.	 Out	of	
11	such	‘immediate	 outcomes’,	 the	immediate	 outcome	3	
provides	that	supervisors	 appropriately	 supervise,	 monitor	
and	regulate	financial	institutions	 for	compliance	 with	AML/
CFT	requirements	commensurate	with	their	risks. 	
The	Reserve	Bank	actively	engaged	with	FATF	assessment 	
team.	As	part	of	evaluation,	 the	Reserve	Bank	elaborated 	
on	the	efficacy	of	the	supervisory	 processes,	 which	
included	the	dedicated	 functional	 KYC/AML 	Group	within	the	Department	 focusing	primarily	on	the	KYC/AML 	risk	
assessment	 at	the	entity	level	as	well	as	at	the	sectoral	
level.	The	use	of	analytical	 model	in	risk	profiling	the	SEs,	
onsite	inspection	 of	‘high’	risk	and	other	identified	 entities,	
supervisory	 inputs	to	the	prudential	 supervisors,	 mechanism 	
of	feedback	 and	guidance	 to	the	SEs	in	identifying	 their	
inherent	risks	(through	 outliers)	and	strengthening	 the	
controls	and	processes	 in	addressing	 the	gaps	were	some	
of	the	critical	aspects,	which	were	elaborately	 discussed 	
with	the	FATF	assessment	team	during	their	onsite	visit. 	
Engagement with SEs
VI.89		The	objective	 of	supervisory/corrective 	
action	is	to	guide	and	incentivise	 the	SEs	to	
remediate	 the	identified	 vulnerabilities	 at	an	
early	stage.	Frequent	 and	wider	interactions 	with	the	SEs	remain	a	critical	tool	to	enhance	
the	effectiveness	 of	the	supervisory	 intervention. 	
The	scope	and	frequency	 of	communication 	
with	the	SEs	is	largely	determined	 by	their	size,	
complexity	and	risk	profile	(Box	VI.5).

REGULATION, SUPERVISION AND FINANCIAL STABILITY139Inter-Regul atory Cooperation with Domestic 
Financial Regulators
VI.90 	The	Reserve	 Bank	is	working	closely	
in	coordination	 with	other	domestic	 financial	
regulators	 for	ensuring	financial	system	resilience.	
Towards	 this	goal,	the	domestic	 regulators	
deliberated	 upon	the	system-wide	 issues	in	the	
financial	sector	during	the	12th	meeting	of	the	
Inter-Regulatory	 Forum	(IRF).	Further,	SE	specific	
issues	were	discussed	 during	the	IRF	meetings	
with	bank-led	financial	conglomerates.
Targeted Assessments
VI.91 	 The	 Reserve	Bank’s	supervisory	 emphasis	
has	been	on	system-wide	 risk	monitoring	 and	
mitigation,	 while	keeping	a	tab	on	entity-specific	
issues.	In	this	context,	 the	Reserve	 Bank	
has	instituted	 a	system	of	targeted	 thematic	
assessments	 aimed	at	examining	 root	cause	of	
system-wide	 concerns	 as	well	as	understanding	
the	idiosyncratic	 risk	build-up	in	some	of	the	
SEs	across	the	system.	These	studies	have	
helped	to	take	corrective	 action	as	well	as	make	
improvements	in	the	systems	and	processes.	
Agenda for 2024-25
VI.92 	 The	 Department	 has	identified	 the	
following	 goals	for	supervision	 of	all	SEs	in	 
2024-25: •Examining	 information	 systems	(IS)	audit	
framework	in	REs ;
 •Examining	 data	governance	 framework	 for	
REs;
 •Developing	 data	quality	index	(DQI)	for	
offsite	returns	(Utkarsh	2.0);
 •Deeper	integration	 of	offsite	analytics	with	
onsite	supervision;	and
 •Validation	 of	supervisory	 data	with	Ministry	
of	Corporate	 Affairs	(MCA)	database	
(Utkarsh	2.0).
Enforcement Department (EFD)
VI.93 		The	 EFD	was	set	up	with	a	view	to	separate	
enforcement	 action	from	supervisory	 process	and	
to	put	in	place	a	structured,	 rule-based	 approach	
to	identify	and	process	violations	 by	the	REs	of	
the	applicable	 policies	and	enforce	the	same	
consistently	 across	the	Reserve	 Bank.	The	
objective	of	enforcement	 is	to	ensure	compliance	
by	the	REs	with	the	rules	and	regulations,	 within	
the	overarching	 principles	 of	financial	stability,	
public	interest	and	consumer	protection.	
Agenda for 2023-24
VI.94 		The	 Department	 had	set	out	the	following	
goal	for	2023-2 4:banks	to	convey	the	supervisory	 expectations.	 Training	
establishments	 of	the	Reserve	Bank	also	regularly	 hold	
programmes	for	assurance	functionaries	of	the	SEs. 	
Calibrated Continuous Supervision
In	addition,	supervisory	teams	constantly	engage	with	SEs 	
at	multiple	levels	during	the	onsite	inspection.	 Under	the	
risk-based	 supervision	 framework,	 apart	from	structured 	
annual	supervisory	 cycle,	the	supervisors	 also	proactively 	
engage	with	the	SEs	based	on	the	evolving	situations. 	In	a	nutshell,	engagement	 with	the	SEs	at	various	levels	
forms	a	critical	part	of	early	and	effective	intervention.	 The	
insights	gained	from	these	engagements	 help	in	alleviating 	
potential	 supervisory	 concerns	 and/or	accentuate	 the	
more	escalated	 supervisory	 interventions	 to	nudge	the	
SEs	towards	desirable	 supervisory	 objectives.	 At	the	same	
time,	gaining	support	from	important	 stakeholders	 also	
enhances	 the	acceptance,	 reduces	the	cost	and,	hence,	
makes	the	supervisory	intervention	more	effective.

Implementation Status 
VI.95 		A	scale-based	 approach	 would	be	put	in	
place	for	enforcement	 action	against	various	types	
of	REs	[banks,	NBFCs,	HFCs,	ARCs,	Factors,	
CICs,	Payment	System	Operators	 (PSOs)]	based	
on	their	size,	complexity,	 interconnectedness, 	
range	of	activities	 and	also	the	seriousness	 of	
violations.	 The	draft	scale-based	 enforcement 	
framework	is	under	finalisation.
VI.96 		During	 2023-24,	 the	Department 	
undertook	 enforcement	 action	against	REs	 
and	imposed	 281	penalties	 aggregating	 ₹86.1	
crore	for	contraventions/non-compliance16	with	
provisions	 of	statutes	and	certain	directions	
issued	by	the	Reserve	Bank	from	time	to	time	
(Table	VI.4).
Other Initiatives
VI.97 	 The	Department	 organised	 a	few	
workshops	 on	enforcement	 action	for	officers	
processing	 cases	in	EFD	central	office	and	
regional	offices.	The	workshops	 were	intended	to	
enhance	the	skills	of	the	participants	 by	sharing	
inputs	on	relevant	legal	and	enforcement-related 	
aspects.	The	Department	 also	provided	faculty	
support	to	National	Bank	for	Agriculture	 and	Rural	
Development	 (NABARD)	 for	capacity	building	of	
its	inspecting	officers.
Agenda for 2024-25

currently	 in	operation	 for	various	categories	 of	
REs	have	similar	design	features,	while	carrying	
certain	variations	 on	operational	 matters.	Based	
on	the	learnings	 from	the	implementation	 of	the	
extant	IO	guidelines,	 it	was	decided	to	harmonise 	
the	instructions	 applicable	 to	the	various	REs	on	
the	IO	mechanism.	 Accordingly,	 Master	Direction	
on	‘Reserve	Bank	of	India	(Internal	Ombudsman 	
for	Regulated	 Entities),	 2023’	was	issued	on	
December	 29,	2023,	which	brings	uniformity	 in	
matters	like	timeline	for	escalation	 of	complaints 	
to	the	IO;	exclusions	 from	escalating	 complaints 	
to	the	IO;	temporary	 absence	of	the	IO;	minimum	
qualifications	 for	appointing	 the	IO;	and	updation	
of	reporting	formats,	in	addition	to	introduction	 of	
the	post	of	Deputy	Internal	Ombudsman.
Major Developments
Opening/Reorganisation of Offices of RBI 
Ombudsman (ORBIOs)
VI.104 	The	Reserve	 Bank	reviewed	 the	
geographic	 presence	 of	the	ORBIOs	and	made	
them	available	 in	different	regions	keeping	in	
view	the	volume	of	origination	 of	complaints. 	
Accordingly,	 a	new	ORBIO	was	operationalised 	
at	Shimla	and	additional	 ORBIOs	 have	been	Agenda for  2023-24
VI.100 	The	Department	 had	proposed	 the	
following	goals	under	Utkarsh 2.0	for	2023-24:
 •Review,	consolidation	 and	updation	of	the	
extant	Reserve	Bank	regulatory	 guidelines 	
on	customer	service	(Paragraph	VI.101);
 •Digitalisation	 of	data	compiled	 through	
incognito	 visits	for	enhanced	 data	utility	
and	analysis	(Paragraph	VI.101);
 •Establish	 Reserve	 Bank	contact	centre	
at	two	additional	 locations	 for	local	
languages,	 including	 disaster	recovery	
(DR)	and	business	 continuity	 plan	(BCP)	
facility	(Paragraph	VI.102);	and
 •Review	and	integration	 of	the	Internal	
Ombudsman	 schemes,	 applicable	 to	
different	RE	types	(Paragraph	VI.103).
Implementation Status 
VI.101 	The	Master	Circular	on	customer	 service	
in	banks	was	published	 in	2015.	The	Reserve	
Bank	is	adopting	a	holistic	approach	 in	review,	
consolidation	 and	updation	 of	the	customer	
service	guidelines.	 Incognito	visits	are	carried	out	
across	the	bank	branches	 in	the	country	through	
regional	offices	of	the	Reserve	Bank.	The	report	
submission	 has	been	digitalised	 for	real	time	
data	availability	 and	better	data	analysis.	 The	
checklists	 for	incognito	 visits	are	also	being	
regularly	 revised	for	effective	 data	collection. 	
The	findings	of	the	visits	are	now	being	actively	
used	as	feedback	 for	supervisory	 and	regulatory 	
inputs.
VI.102 	In	response	 to	a	surge	in	customer	
calls,	the	Reserve	 Bank’s	contact	centre	has	
undergone	 a	strategic	 evolution	 aimed	at	
improving	 customer	 satisfaction	 and	operational 	
efficiency.	 The	existing	standalone	 contact	centre	
at	Chandigarh	 was	upgraded	 to	a	state-of-the-art 	
facility,	with	additional	 facilities	at	Bhubaneswar 	

ANNUAL REPORT 2023-24142Customer	 centricity	 is	about	providing	 solutions	 based	
on		understanding	 of	customers’ 	needs,	preferences,	 and	
behaviours	 (World	Bank,	2014).	Six	common	core	outcomes	
emerge	from	the	customer	 perspective	 (World	Bank,	2020):	
(a)	Suitability	 and	appropriateness	 (i.e.,	having	access	
to	quality	services	that	are	affordable	 and	appropriate); 	
(b)	Choice	(i.e.,	having	range	of	products/services); 	 
(c)	Safety	and	security	(i.e.,	money	and	information 	
are	kept	safe,	and	service	providers	 respect	privacy	of	 
information);	 (d)	Fairness	and	respect	(i.e.,	treating	with	
respect	and	safeguard	 clients’	interest);	 (e)	Voice	(i.e., 
communication	 through	easily	accessible	 channel,	 with	
problems	 getting	quickly	resolved	with	minimal	cost);	and	
(f)	Meets	purpose	(i.e.,	to	be	in	a	better	position	to	manage	
financial	products	or	shock	or	to	attain	other	goals).	In	line	
with	these	core	outcomes,	 the	OECD/G20	 ‘High-Level 	
Principles	 on	Financial	Consumer	 Protection’ 	were	updated

Customer Centric Measures by Reserve Bank of India 
Customer Centric Policies of Reserve Bank 
The	Reserve	 Bank,	being	a	full-service	 central	bank,	
has	a	diverse	functional	 mandate.	 Depositors’ 	protection	
responsibility	 has	been	entrusted	 to	the	Reserve	Bank	
under	the	Banking	Regulation	 Act,	194918,	long	before	the	
concepts	 like	customer	 service,	customer	 satisfaction	 and	
customer	 centricity	 found	an	entry	into	the	lexicon	of	the	
banking	sector	(Leeladhar,	 2007).	The	Reserve	Bank’s	
enduring	 concern	for	the	quality	of	customer	 services	in	
the	REs	has	led	to	continuing 	initiatives	 over	decades,	
including	 setting	up	of	various	Committees19	on	customer	
service.	Towards	ensuring	fair	treatment	 of	the	customer	
and	adequate	 quality	of	customer	 service	at	a	reasonable	
cost,	appropriate 	interventions	 from	the	regulators	 become	
important.	
Over	the	years,	the	Reserve	Bank	has	put	in	place	various	
institutional	 mechanisms	 aimed	at	improving	 the	customer	
service	in	the	REs	such	as	‘One	Nation-One	 Ombudsman’ 	
(Contd.)operationalised	 at	Chennai	 and	Kolkata.	
All	Ombudsman	 offices	operate	under	the	
overarching	 ‘One	Nation	One	Ombudsman’ 	
principle.	
Committee for Review of the Customer Service 
Standards and Practices in REs
VI.105 	A	Committee	 for	review	of	customer	
service	standards	 in	the	REs	was	set-up	by	the	
Reserve	Bank	on	May	23,	2022.	The	Committee’s 	report	was	placed	in	the	public	domain	on	June	
5,	2023.	The	recommendations	 of	the	Committee 	
along	with	comments	 received	from	stakeholders 	
are	being	examined	for	implementation.
Customer Centric Measures
VI.106 The	Reserve	 Bank	undertook	 130	
customer	 centric	initiatives	 during	2021-22	
to	2023-24	to	improve	customer	 service	and	
satisfaction	(Box	VI.6).

the	affairs	of	any	banking	company	being	conducted	 in	a	manner	detrimental	 to	the	interests	of	the	depositors.	 The	Reserve	Bank	derives	
similar	powers	under	the	RBI	Act,	1934	for	non-banking	 financial	companies	 (NBFCs)	and	Payment	and	Settlement	 Systems	Act,	2007	for	
system	participants.

6. CONCLUSION
VI.111 	The	Reserve	 Bank	undertook	 several	
measures	 to	safeguard	 the	financial	 system	
by	further	strengthening	 the	regulatory	 and	
supervisory	 framework	 of	the	banking	 and	
non-banking	 sector	in	line	with	the	global	best	
practices.	 Going	forward,	concerted	 efforts	would	
be	made	towards	issuing	frameworks	 in	the	
areas	of	resolution	 of	stress	in	projects	under	
implementation,	 securitisation	 of	stressed	assets	
and	expected	credit	loss.	Augmenting	 supervisory 	
capabilities	 by	a	suite	of	SupTech	data	tools	on	
micro-data	 analytics	and	other	similar	use	cases,	
using	AI/ML	and	integration	 of	offsite	analytics	
with	onsite	supervision	 would	also	engage	
attention,	 along	with	further	strengthening	 of	the	
enforcement	 framework.	 Enhancing	 the	customer	
service	standards	 along	with	fine-tuning	 the	
existing	grievance	 redress	mechanism	 would	
also	remain	focus	areas.
21 Deposit	accounts	are	called	so	when	the	depositor	 has	one	or	more	types	of	deposit	accounts	and	in	one	or	more	branches	 of	a	bank	in	
his/her	personal	name.	This	also	includes	deposit	held	in	the	name	of	the	proprietary	 concern	where	the	depositor	 is	the	sole	proprietor.	 If	
the	depositor	 has	deposit	accounts	in	his/her	capacity	as	a	partner	of	a	firm/guardian	 of	a	minor/director	 of	a	company/trustee	 of	a	trust/joint	
account,	in	one	or	more	branches	 of	the	bank	then	such	accounts	are	considered	 as	held	in	different	capacity	and	different	right.	In	the	case	
of	joint	accounts,	 if	individuals	 open	more	than	one	joint	accounts	in	which	their	names	are	not	in	the	same	order	or	group	of	persons	are	
different,	then	the	deposits	held	in	these	joint	accounts	are	considered	as	held	in	the	different	capacity	and	different	right.

PUBLIC DEBT MANAGEMENTVII.1 The Internal Debt Management 
Department (IDMD) of the Reserve Bank is 
entrusted with the responsibility of managing 
the domestic debt of the central government by 
statute vide Sections 20 and 21 of the Reserve 
Bank of India (RBI) Act, 1934, and of 28 state 
governments and two union territories (UTs) in 
accordance with respective bilateral agreements 
as provided in Section 21A of the RBI Act. In 
terms of Section 17(5) of the RBI Act, 1934, 
short-term credit up to three months is provided 
to both the central and state governments in the 
form of ways and means advances (WMA) to 
bridge temporary mismatches in their cash flows.
VII.2 The gross fiscal deficit (per cent to GDP) of 
the central government in 2023-24 was budgeted 
lower than the previous year. Market borrowings 
by the central and state governments remained 
elevated due to increase in their financing 
requirements. Notwithstanding global headwinds 
and tighter domestic financial conditions, the 
Reserve Bank ensured completion of the market 
borrowing programme for both central and 
state governments in a non-disruptive manner, 
keeping in mind the three broad objectives of 
cost optimisation, risk mitigation and market 
development. The weighted average yield of market borrowing for central government 
softened by 8 basis points (bps) during the 
year. The maturity profile of outstanding dated 
securities was elongated to contain the rollover 
risk. The Reserve Bank in consultation with the 
central government issued sovereign green 
bonds (SGrBs) for an amount aggregating to 
₹20,000 crore during 2023-24.
VII.3 The remainder of the chapter is arranged 
under three sections. Section 2  presents the 
implementation status in respect of the agenda 
for 2023-24 along with major developments 
during the year in the areas of debt management 
for both central and state governments. Section 
3  covers major initiatives to be undertaken in 
2024-25, followed by a summary in the  last 
section.
2. Agenda for 2023-24
VII.4 The Department had set out the following 
goals for 2023-24:
● Consolidation of debt through calendar 
driven, auction-based switch operations 
along with reissuance of securities 
to augment liquidity in the G-sec 
market and facilitate fresh issuances 
(Paragraph VII.5-VII.6);As the debt manager to the central and state governments, the Reserve Bank manages the government market 
borrowing programme in a non-disruptive manner while adhering to the broad objectives of cost optimisation, risk 
mitigation and market development. During 2023-24, while the government securities (G-secs) yields softened, 
the weighted average coupon on the entire outstanding debt stock increased marginally. The weighted average 
maturity of primary issuances increased as compared to the previous year . An ultra-long 50-year G-sec was 
introduced to cater to the demand from long-term investors. Issuances of sovereign green bonds also continued 
during the year .PUBLIC DEBT MANAGEMENT VII

ANNUAL REPORT 2023-24● Development of a mobile application for 
improving the ease of access for retail 
investors under the ‘RBI Retail Direct 
Scheme’ (Paragraph VII.7);
● Taking appropriate measures for 
enhancing retail investor awareness about 
the ‘RBI Retail Direct Scheme’ (Paragraph 
VII.7);
● Implementation of Society for Worldwide 
Interbank Financial Telecommunications 
(SWIFT) module for putting through 
transactions of foreign central banks 
(FCBs) [Paragraph VII.8];
● Expansion of the coverage of government 
debt statistics in RBI’s data warehouse 
system (Paragraph VII.9); and
● Conduct of capacity building programmes 
for sensitising the state governments 
about prudent practices in cash and debt 
management (Paragraph VII.10).
Implementation Status
VII.5 The Reserve Bank successfully completed 
the combined gross market borrowings of the 
central and state governments to the tune of  
₹25.5 lakh crore, which was 17.0 per cent higher 
than the previous year. The Reserve Bank 
continued with its policy of passive consolidation 
by way of reissuances and active consolidation 
through switches. During 2023-24, there were 
135 re-issuances out of 149 issuances of 
G-secs (90.6 per cent) as compared with 161  
re-issuances out of 177 issuances (91 per cent) in 
the previous year. The active debt consolidation 
through switching of government securities 
maturing in the near-term with the long-dated 
government securities was generally conducted once in a month. Accordingly, switches amounting 
to ₹1.03 lakh crore were completed during  
2023-24 as against the budgeted amount of  
₹1 lakh crore.
VII.6 During 2023-24, securities ranging from  
3 to 50 years tenor (original maturity) were 
issued with the objective of catering to the 
requirement of various investors with appetite 
for securities of different maturity buckets. A 
new 3-year benchmark security was introduced 
as part of government market borrowing 
programme during H1:2023-24. Another dated 
security of 50-year maturity was introduced in  
H2:2023-24 in response to market demand for 
ultra-long duration securities. The total issuance 
of SGrBs during 2023-24 was ₹20,000 crore, with 
issuances in 5-year (₹5,000 crore) and 10-year 
(₹5,000 crore) tenors in addition to the maiden 
issuance of SGrBs in 30 years (₹10,000 crore) 
tenor.
VII.7 To further improve the ease of access for 
retail investors in the ‘RBI Retail Direct’ portal, 
development of mobile application is under final 
stages and is expected to be rolled out in early 
2024-25. During the year, the Reserve Bank 
continued its efforts aimed at improving the overall 
reach of ‘RBI Retail Direct Scheme’ through 
investor awareness programmes. In order to 
ease the registration process and to make the 
portal more user friendly, various technological 
upgrades have been undertaken. The basket 
of products offered through the ‘Retail Direct’ 
portal has also been expanded to include floating 
rate savings bond (FRSB), 2020 (Taxable). The 
national automated clearing house (NACH) 
payment functionality has also been enabled 
on the portal, enabling the investors to register  
one-time mandate and use the same for funding 
bids placed under primary auction.

PUBLIC DEBT MANAGEMENTVII.8 The Department carries out investments 
on behalf of FCBs and other multilateral 
financial  institutions (MFls) under  the  scheme 
of Rupee investment by FCBs.  The SWIFT 
module has been operationalised that enables 
messaging using SWIFT network for back-office 
activities related to the transactions carried out 
under the scheme. 
VII.9 Government debt statistics are 
disseminated through the Reserve Bank’s 
website and data warehouse system. During 
the year, time series information was migrated 
to the Reserve Bank’s next-generation data 
warehouse system, i.e., centralised information 
management system (CIMS).
VII.10 Capacity building programmes (CBPs) 
for sensitising state governments about prudent 
cash and debt management practices were 
conducted for some states. In addition, a  
two-day CBP on cash and debt management 
was conducted in the Reserve Bank’s College of 
Agricultural Banking (CAB), Pune, in December 
2023 which witnessed participation from 11 state 
governments and the UT of Puducherry.Major Developments
Debt Management of the Central Government
VII.11 During 2023-24, both gross and net 
market borrowings of Government of India (GoI) 
through dated G-secs were higher by 8.6 per cent 
and 6.5 per cent, respectively, as compared to 
the previous year. Net market borrowings through 
dated securities and T-Bills taken together were 
higher by 4.6 per cent as compared with the 
previous year (Table VII.1).
Debt Management Operations
VII.12 The weighted average yield (WAY) of 
G-secs issued during the year decreased by 
8 bps as compared to the previous year, while 
the weighted average coupon on the entire 
debt stock increased by 3 bps. The weighted 
average maturity (WAM) of primary issuances 
and the outstanding debt as at end-March 2024 
increased as compared to the previous year 
(Table VII.2).
VII.13 There was no devolvement on Primary 
Dealers (PDs) during 2023-24 as compared 
to eight instances, amounting to ₹23,053 
crore in 2022-23. There was no instance of

to four instances for a total notified amount of 
₹16,000 crore in the previous year.
VII.14 G-sec yields softened during the year 
mainly driven by easing of inflationary pressures, 
expectations of a possible end to the monetary 
policy tightening cycle across major economies 
and surge in foreign portfolio investment (FPI) 
inflows. The yields declined sharply in April 
and May on the back of unchanged repo rate 
and lower than expected domestic consumer 
price index (CPI) prints for March and April. 
Though 10-year yield hardened slightly in June, 
overall, it softened by 21 bps in Q1 to close at  
7.10 per cent as at end-June 2023. During 
Q2:2023-24, the yields rose tracking US treasury 
yields, higher crude oil prices, and higher than 
expected domestic CPI prints for July. The  
10-year yield hardened by 12 bps in Q2 to close 
at 7.22 per cent as at end-September 2023. In 
Q3:2023-24, the yields initially rose but softened 
thereafter on account of decline in crude oil prices, 
lower than expected domestic CPI prints for 
October and November and news about possible inclusion of Indian government bonds (IGBs) 
in a major global emerging market index. The  
10-year yield declined by 2 bps in Q3 to close 
at 7.20 per cent as at end-December 2023. The 
yields declined further during Q4:2023-24 on lower  
than expected CPI and reduced market borrowing 
and budgeted fiscal deficit for 2024-25. The  
10-year yield softened by 13 bps in Q4 to close at 
7.07 per cent as on March 28, 2024 (Chart VII.1).Table VII.2: Market Loans of Central Government - A Profile*

market borrowing was raised through issuance of 
dated securities, with a residual maturity of 10 
years and above as compared with 48.9 per cent 
in the previous year (Table VII.3).
Treasury Bills
VII.16  Short-term cash requirements of the   
central government are met through issuance 
of  T-Bills. The net short-term market borrowing 
of  the government through T-Bills (91, 182 and 
364  days) declined to ₹48,349 crore during  
2023-24 from ₹66,114 crore in the previous year.

accounting for 37.6 per cent as at end-March 2024, 
followed by insurance companies (25.0 per cent), 
provident funds (10.1 per cent) and the Reserve 
Bank (7.9 per cent). The share of FPIs was 1.5 per

commitment and success ratio in respect of 
primary auctions of T-Bills/cash management bills 
(CMBs). The PDs achieved an average success 
ratio of 59.3 per cent in H1:2023-24 and 62.2 per 
cent in H2:2023-24. The share of PDs in auctions 
of T-Bills was 69.4 per cent during 2023-24 as 
compared with 68.9 per cent in the previous year. 
The commission paid to PDs, including GST, for 
underwriting primary auctions of dated G-secs 
during 2023-24 was ₹48.5 crore as compared to 
₹107.5 crore during 2022-23.
Sovereign Gold Bond (SGB) Scheme

Cash Management of the Central Government
VII.21 The WMA limit of the central government 
was fixed at ₹1.5 lakh crore and ₹0.5 lakh crore for 
H1 and H2 of 2023-24, respectively. The central 
government resorted to WMA/overdraft (OD) for 
24 days during 2023-24 vis-à-vis 9 days in the 
previous year. The cash balance of the central 
government remained in surplus during most part 
of the year (Chart VII.2).
Investments under Foreign Central Bank (FCB) 
Scheme
VII.22 Under the FCB scheme, the Reserve Bank 
invests in Indian G-secs on behalf of select FCBs 
and multilateral development institutions in the 
secondary G-sec market. Total volume transacted 
on behalf of these institutions stood at ₹920 crore 
(face value) during 2023-24 as compared to 
₹4,805 crore (face value) in the previous year.Debt Management of State Governments
VII.23 Following the recommendations of the 
14th Finance Commission to exclude most of the 
states from the National Small Savings Fund 
(NSSF) financing facility, market borrowings 
of states have been increasing over the last 
few years. The share of market borrowings in 
financing the  gross fiscal deficit of states rose to 
76.1 per cent in 2023-24 (BE) from 72.4 per cent 
in 2022-23 (RE).
VII.24 The gross market borrowings of states 
in 2023-24 stood at 93 per cent of the amount 
indicated in the quarterly indicative calendar for 
market borrowings by the state governments. 
There were 782 issuances in 2023-24, of 
which 49 were re-issuances (605 issuances in  
2022-23, of which 45 were re-issuances)  
[Table VII.4].
VII.25 The weighted average cut-off yield (WAY) 
of SGSs issuances during 2023-24 was lower at 
7.52 per cent than 7.71 per cent in the previous 
year. The weighted average spread (WAS) of 
SGSs issuances over comparable maturity of 
central government securities was 31 bps in  
2023-24, the same as in the previous year. In 
2023-24, 23 states and two UTs issued dated 
securities of tenors other than 10 year, ranging 
from 2 to 40 years. The average inter-state spread 
on securities of 10-year tenor (fresh issuances) 
was 3 bps in 2023-24, the same as in 2022-23.
VII.26 During 2023-24, 15 states/UTs availed 
Special Drawing Facility (SDF), 14 states/UTs 
resorted to WMA and 11 states/UTs availed OD.
VII.27 Keeping in view the risks associated with 
contingent liabilities, it was decided during the

Guarantee is a potential liability that is contingent on the 
occurrence of an unforeseen future event. If these liabilities 
get crystallised without adequate buffer, it may lead to 
increase in expenditure, fiscal deficit, and debt levels for the 
state government. If the guarantee invoked is not honoured, 
it may cause reputational damage and legal costs to the 
guarantor. A related concern is the increasing bank finance 
to government owned entities backed by their guarantees. 
It is, therefore, important to assess, monitor and be prudent 
while issuing guarantees, especially, when such guarantees 
are issued by a state government.
The major recommendations of the Working Group are as 
under:
a. There should not be any distinction between conditional/
unconditional, financial/performance guarantees;
b. The word ‘Guarantee’ should be used in a broader 
sense and may include instruments, by whatever name 
they were called, if these create obligation on the state 
government;
c. Government guarantees should not be used to obtain 
finance through state owned entities, which substitutes 
budgetary resources of the state government;
d. States should classify the projects/activities as high, 
medium and low-risk and assign appropriate risk weights 
before extending guarantee for them;Box VII.1
Working Group on State Government Guarantees
e. There should be a ceiling for incremental guarantees 
issued during a year at 5 per cent of revenue  
receipts or 0.5 per cent of gross state domestic 
product (GSDP), whichever is less. States should  
conservatively keep the lowest slab of risk weight at  
100 per cent;
f. A minimum of 0.25 per cent per annum may be 
considered as the base or minimum guarantee fee and 
additional risk premium, based on risk assessment by 
the state government, may be charged to each risk 
category of issuances;
g. States should build a buffer of five per cent of their total 
outstanding guarantees over a period of five years from 
the date of constitution of guarantee redemption fund 
(GRF);
h. The borrowing state enterprises should set up escrow 
accounts with periodic contributions from project 
earnings for repayments before resorting to state 
government guarantees; and
i. States should publish/disclose data relating to 
guarantees as per the Indian Government Accounting 
Standards (IGAS).

4. Conclusion
VII.31 During the year, the market borrowings 
of the central and state governments were 
successfully conducted amidst challenges 
emanating from volatility in global financial 
markets and geopolitical tensions. The market 
borrowing programme for 2024-25 would be rolled 
out in an orderly manner keeping in view the size 
of the budgeted fiscal deficit of the government 
and evolving market conditions. The Reserve 
Bank would continue to ensure smooth conduct 
of the market borrowing programme based on 
the guiding principles of debt management while 
ensuring a stable debt structure.

CURRENCY MANAGEMENT153CURRENCY MANAGEMENT VIII
VIII.1 During 2023-24, the Reserve Bank 
sustained its efforts to ensure adequate supply 
of clean banknotes and coins in the economy to 
meet the demand for cash from the public. The 
withdrawal of soiled banknotes and momentum 
of their disposal also continued. For better 
assessment of the requirement for banknotes 
going forward, an analysis was undertaken to 
glean insights from the trends in household cash 
usage for transactional purposes. The Reserve 
Bank embarked upon an exercise to modernise 
the currency management infrastructure in the 
country. The withdrawal of ₹2000 denomination 
banknotes, which were introduced in November 
2016 to expeditiously meet the currency 
requirement of the economy post withdrawal of 
legal tender status of ₹500 and ₹1000 banknotes 
from circulation, was undertaken.
VIII.2 Against this backdrop, the rest of the 
chapter is organised into five sections. Section 2 
covers the implementation status of the agenda 
for 2023-24, followed by important developments 
in currency in circulation along with other activities 
during the year in section 3. The developments 
with regard to Bharatiya Reserve Bank Note Mudran Private Ltd. (BRBNMPL), a wholly-
owned subsidiary of the Reserve Bank, are 
given in section 4. The Department’s agenda for 
2024-25 is provided in section 5 with concluding 
observations in section 6.
2. Agenda for 2023-24
VIII.3 The Department had set out the following 
goals for 2023-24:
● Preparation of an implementation 
programme based on recommendations 
of the report on currency network design; 
mechanisation and automation; and 
scheduling and inventory management 
for achieving higher efficiency in currency 
management (Paragraph VIII.4); 
● Establishment of a state-of-the-art facility 
for conducting cutting edge research 
on banknotes (Utkarsh 2.0) [Paragraph 
VIII.5];
● Conducting survey on quality of notes 
in circulation (Utkarsh 2.0) [Paragraph 
VIII.6];
● Developing cash usage indicators 
(Utkarsh 2.0) [Paragraph VIII.7]; During the year , the Reserve Bank remained focused on its endeavour to provide adequate quantity of clean 
banknotes in circulation. In pursuance of this, the process of withdrawal of ₹ 2000 denomination banknotes 
was also undertaken. A survey was conducted to have better insights on the usage and preference for 
banknotes, coins and digital modes of payments in the country. An exercise was initiated to revamp the extant  
currency management architecture in the country to benefit from state-of-the-art technologies and enhance its 
operational efficiency. 

ANNUAL REPORT 2023-24154● Implementation of recommendations 
of the Committee for review of extant 
mechanism of cash dispensation and 
related issues in automated teller machine 
(ATM) ecosystem (Paragraph VIII.8); and
● Institutionalisation of the process of 
certification of note sorting machines 
(NSMs) in alignment with the prescribed 
sorting standards (Utkarsh 2.0)  
[Paragraph VIII.9].
Implementation Status 
VIII.4 An action plan has been formulated 
for redesigning and modernising the currency 
management architecture through use of network 
optimisation, technological solutions, automation 
and business process re-engineering. The 
project involving various stakeholders would be 
implemented in phases.
VIII.5 An adversarial analysis1  laboratory has 
been operationalised at the Mysuru campus of 
BRBNMPL for conducting cutting edge research 
on banknotes. 
VIII.6 Surveys on public perception of the 
quality of banknotes were carried out in various 
regions, which helped in understanding the 
public requirement and accordingly, necessary 
policy and operational measures were taken.
VIII.7 An analysis to understand the recent 
trends in household cash usage for transactional 
purposes vis-à-vis the growth in retail digital 
payments was carried out in the Department 
to help in better estimation of demand for 
banknotes, going forward. The methodology 
would be updated based on incoming data to 
make the cash usage indicators more robust. VIII.8 The recommendations of the Committee  
for review of extant mechanism of cash 
dispensation and related issues in ATM 
ecosystem are currently under various stages of 
implementation.
VIII.9 The institutionalisation of the process of 
certification of note sorting machines (NSMs) 
in alignment with the prescribed sorting 
standards was undertaken by the Bureau of 
Indian Standards (BIS) at the behest of the 
Reserve Bank, wherein a panel comprising 
industry experts, standard setters from BIS, RBI 
and banks was constituted, which finalised the 
technical standards for NSMs. The ‘Note Sorting 
Machines (NSMs) Specification IS 18663 : 2024’ 
was published in ‘The Gazette of India’ on March 
19, 2024. These standards shall be utilised for 
certification of NSMs used by banks across the 
country and will bring in uniformity in note sorting 
across the banks. 
3. Developments in Currency in Circulation
VIII.10 Currency in circulation includes 
banknotes, central bank digital currency (CBDC) 
and coins. Presently, banknotes in circulation 
comprise denominations of ₹2, ₹5, ₹10, ₹20, ₹50, 
₹100, ₹200, ₹500 and ₹2000. The Reserve Bank 
is no longer printing banknotes of denominations 
of ₹2, ₹5 and ₹2000. Coins in circulation 
comprise 50 paise and ₹1, ₹2, ₹5, ₹10 and ₹20 
denominations. The Reserve Bank has been 
publishing denomination-wise data on currency 
in circulation on a weekly basis from the week 
ended December 29, 2023.
1 Conducted to assess counterfeiting risks through in-house simulation of banknote features by trained experts/technicians using 
commercially available materials and equipment.

Source: RBI.VIII.11 In terms of Section 22A of the 
RBI Act, 1934, denominations as set out 
in Section 24 of the Act, do not apply to 
banknotes in digital form. Accordingly, the 
live-pilot of Digital Rupee-Retail (e₹-R)  
has been launched in denominations of 50 
paise, ₹1, ₹2, ₹5, ₹10, ₹20, ₹50, ₹100, ₹200, 
₹500 and ₹2000, while e₹-Wholesale (e₹-W) 
does not have any specific denomination.
Banknotes
VIII.12 The value and volume of banknotes 
in circulation increased by 3.9 per cent and 
7.8 per cent, respectively, during 2023-24 as 
compared with an increase of 7.8 per cent and 
4.4 per cent, respectively, during the previous 
year (Table VIII.1). During 2023-24, the share 
of ₹500 banknotes increased in value terms 
whereas that of ₹2000 banknotes declined 
sharply reflecting the withdrawal of the latter denomination from circulation. In volume terms, 
₹500 denomination constituted the highest share 
of the total banknotes in circulation, followed by 
₹10 denomination banknotes as on March 31, 
2024. 
Withdrawal of ₹2000 Denomination Banknotes 
from Circulation
VIII.13 The ₹2000 denomination banknote was 
introduced in November 2016 under Section 
24(1) of the RBI Act, primarily to meet the currency 
requirement of the economy in an expeditious 
manner after the withdrawal of legal tender status 
of ₹500 and ₹1000 banknotes in circulation at 
that time. The objective of introducing ₹2000 
banknotes was met once banknotes in other 
denominations became available in adequate 
quantities. Therefore, printing of ₹2000 banknotes 
was stopped in 2018-19.

ANNUAL REPORT 2023-24156VIII.14 About 89 per cent of the ₹2000 
denomination banknotes were at the end of their 
estimated life span of 4-5 years and were not 
commonly used for transactions. It was, therefore, 
decided to withdraw the ₹2000 denomination 
banknotes from circulation, while continuing their 
legal tender status. A press release was issued on 
May 19, 2023 advising the public to deposit and/
or exchange ₹2000 banknotes at bank branches 
and at the 19 issue offices2 of the Reserve Bank 
till September 30, 2023, which was later extended 
up to October 7, 2023. From October 9, 2023, the 
facility for deposit and/or exchange is available at 
the Reserve Bank issue offices. Further, ₹2000 
banknotes can be sent through India Post to 
the Reserve Bank issue offices in lieu of credit 
in their bank accounts. Of the ₹3.56 lakh crore of ₹2000 banknotes in circulation as on May 
19, 2023 when the withdrawal was announced,  
97.7 per cent had returned to the banking system 
up to March 31, 2024. 
Coins 
VIII.15 The total value as well as volume of 
coins in circulation increased in 2023-24. As on 
March 31, 2024, coins of ₹1, ₹2 and ₹5 together 
constituted 82.5 per cent of the total volume 
of coins in circulation, while in value terms, 
these denominations accounted for 68 per cent  
(Table VIII.2).
e₹ in Circulation 
VIII.16 The live pilot of e₹-R, launched on 
December 1, 2022, gained momentum during the 
year (Table VIII.3).

The survey covered a total of 22,725 respondents, 
comprising 11,474 consumers and 11,251 merchants (viz., 
small manufacturers, retail traders and service providers) 
spread across 20 states/union territories. Around 63 per 
cent of the total respondents were from rural and semi-
urban areas, 19 per cent from urban areas and 18 per cent 
from metropolitan centres.
Major Findings
Consumers
According to the survey, 56.7 per cent of the consumer 
respondents required coins predominantly for tendering 
change while shopping, travelling and for making donations. 
The need for ₹5 coins was the highest, followed by ₹2 and 
₹10. A majority of the respondents reported that they had not 
faced any shortage of coins in the last one year.
With regard to banknotes, more than 80 per cent of the 
consumer respondents required banknotes for shopping, 
travelling, making utility/fee payments and for emergencies.  Box VIII.1
Survey on the Usage of Coins and Banknotes
More than 70 per cent of the respondents cited better 
availability of banknotes of ₹100 and above vis-à-vis 
banknotes of ₹50 and below. Around 80 per cent of the 
respondents did not encounter scarcity of banknotes in the 
last one year.
With increasing ticket size of transactions, the preference 
among consumer respondents has shifted towards 
digital payments. Compared to the all-India average, the 
penetration of digital payment usage was less in rural areas 
due to lower familiarity with digital payment modes, besides 
safety concerns. This disparity was more pronounced 
among the people of age 60 years and above.
Merchants
Around two-thirds of the merchant respondents utilised coins 
for business transactions, travelling and donations, with its 
usage being higher among retail traders followed by service 
providers. The requirement for ₹5 coins was the highest 
followed by ₹2 coins and ₹10 coins. Around 25 per cent of to assess the shortage/surfeit of cash and coins 
(Box VIII.1).

ANNUAL REPORT 2023-24160Procurement of New Shredding and Briquetting 
Systems (SBS)
VIII.24 During the year, purchase orders were 
placed for procurement of new shredding and 
briquetting systems for 21 regional offices 
following due tendering process. Delivery 
and installation of these SBS machines will 
commence from Q1:2024-25 and is likely to be 
completed in the next two years for all the offices.
Mobile Coin Vans (MCVs) for Distribution of 
Coins – Expansion in Geographical Reach and 
Operational Scope
VIII.25 To enhance distribution of coins, the 
scheme of MCVs operating in select states has 
been extended across the country. Additionally, 
the scope of services has been broadened to 
facilitate the exchange of lower denomination 
notes, which are unfit for circulation. These MCVs 
distribute coins and banknotes to the public 
located particularly in semi-urban, rural and 
remote areas.
Awareness Campaign on Mobile Aided Note 
Identifier (MANI) App and Misinformation on 
Coins
VIII.26 The MANI App was launched on January 
1, 2020 to facilitate visually impaired persons to 
identify denomination of Indian banknotes. The 
App notifies the banknote denomination in 11 
regional languages apart from Hindi and English. A pan India radio campaign through Akashvani/
Vividh Bharti/private FM radio channels was 
conducted to promote awareness on the MANI 
App.
VIII.27 During the year, the Reserve Bank 
embarked on an awareness campaign through 
a media mix of print and radio to dispel 
misinformation about coins among members of 
the public.
Procurement of New Security Features for Indian 
Banknotes
VIII.28 The Reserve Bank is actively taking 
forward the process of introduction of new/
upgraded security features for banknotes.
4. Bharatiya Reserve Bank Note Mudran 
Private Ltd. (BRBNMPL)
VIII.29 The BRBNMPL has been playing a critical 
role in designing, printing and supply of banknotes. 
It has been a key partner of the Reserve 
Bank in implementation of its strategic goal of 
indigenisation of banknote production, including 
backward integration for raw materials. The 
procurements by BRBNMPL are compliant with 
directions issued under ‘Make in India’ initiative 
by the Government of India. BRBNMPL presses 
have increased direct remittances of banknotes 
to currency chests, resulting in enhanced 
logistical efficiency and cost effectiveness. At the 
behest of the Reserve Bank, BRBNMPL is also  the respondents cited shortage of coins in the last one year 
with 41 per cent of those deeming it as a seasonal factor. 
As regards banknotes, about 90 per cent of the merchant 
respondents utilised them for business transactions, 
travelling and exigencies. Easy availability of banknotes 
particularly of ₹100 and above was noted by the 
respondents. Above 80 per cent of the respondents 
reported that they did not face scarcity of banknotes in last 
one year.There was a preference for digital payments with increase 
in transaction value. However, non-familiarity with digital 
payment modes and safety concerns were reported as 
impediments in the usage of digital payment options, 
especially in rural and semi-urban areas.
In sum, the survey indicated that, while cash remained 
prevalent, the digital modes of payment were gaining 
traction among the public.

CURRENCY MANAGEMENT161establishing a Currency Research and 
Development Centre (CRDC) at its Mysuru 
campus for conducting cutting-edge research in 
the domain of currency. 
5. Agenda for 2024-25
VIII.30 During the year, the Department will focus 
on the following:
● Carrying forward the project on 
modernisation of the currency 
management infrastructure;
● Replacement of existing SBS machines;
● Exploring more sustainable and eco-
friendly disposal of currency note 
briquettes; 
● Finetuning policies and initiating measures 
for improving delivery of banknotes/coins 
to members of the public; and
● Implementation of technical standards 
issued by BIS for NSMs used by banks 
across the country.6. Conclusion
VIII.31 During 2023-24, the Reserve Bank 
continued with initiatives to enhance banknote 
distribution efficiency, increase public awareness 
on banknotes and coins and ensure availability of 
adequate quantity of clean banknotes and coins 
for the public. The Reserve Bank formulated an 
action plan for modernisation and automation 
of currency management infrastructure and 
smoothly conducted the process of withdrawal of 
₹2000 denomination banknotes from circulation. 
Going forward, the Reserve Bank’s endeavour 
would be to modernise the currency management 
infrastructure and sustain the self-sufficiency 
in banknote production. Analytical research for 
further strengthening the integrity of banknotes 
and understanding the trends in public preference 
for cash vis-à-vis other modes of payment shall 
continue to remain a focus area.

devices,	 and	other	contemporary	 devices.	 It	
has	improved	 the	availability	 of	acceptance

real-time	 feature,	has	transformed	 the	digital	payments	
ecosystem	 in	India.	A	fast	payment	system	like	UPI	with	
features	like	instant	transfer	of	funds	(24X7),	use	of	virtual	
payment	 address,	 facilitation	 of	peer-to-peer  (P2P)	 and	
peer-to-merchant	 (P2M)	transactions	 is	immensely	 useful	to	
the	users.	The	steady	stream	of	innovations	 has	enhanced	
its	usefulness	 and	ease	of	use,	which	has	resulted	in	UPI	
becoming	 the	single	largest	retail	payment	system	in	terms

wallet,	linking	RuPay	credit	cards	to	UPI,	and	processing	
mandates	 with	single-block-and-multiple-debits.	 Continuing	
this	trend,	the	following	new	enhancements	 were	introduced	
in	UPI	during	2023-24:
i.	An	innovative	 payment	 mode,	 viz.,	‘Conversational	
Payments’ 	was	enabled	in	UPI	to	allow	users	to	engage	
in	conversation	 with	an	artificial	intelligence	 (AI)-
powered	system	to	initiate	and	complete	transactions	 in	
a	safe	and	secure	environment. 	This	channel	is	made	
available	 in	both	smartphones 	and	feature	phones-Box IX.1
Enhancements in UPI to Facilitate User Access and Convenience

country;
ii.	UPI	Lite	on-device	 wallet	has	been	gaining	traction	and	
currently	processes	 more	than	10	million	transactions	
a	month.	To	promote	 the	use	of	UPI-Lite,	 offline	
transactions	 using	near	field	communication	 (NFC)	
technology	 were	also	enabled.	This	feature	not	only	
allows	retail	digital	payments	 in	situations	 where	
internet/telecom	 connectivity	 is	weak	or	not	available,	
but	also	ensures	faster	transactions,	 with	minimal	
rejections;	and
iii.	The	scope	of	UPI	was	expanded	 by	enabling	transfer	
to/from	pre-sanctioned	 credit	lines	at	banks	in	addition	
to	deposit	accounts.	 In	other	words,	UPI	network	will	
facilitate	payments	 financed	 by	credit	from	banks.	
This	can	reduce	the	cost	of	such	offerings	and	help	in	
development	of	unique	products	for	Indian	markets.
Such	innovations	 on	an	ongoing	basis	have	facilitated	 the	
expansion	 of	usage	and	user	base	of	UPI	and	enabled	the	
provision	of	digital	payment	instruments	as	‘public	goods.’

have	been	prescribed	 to	include	PAs-Cross 	
Border	as	well	under	the	regulatory	 purview	of	the	
Reserve	Bank. 	
Agenda for 2023-24 
IX.9	 The	 Department	 had	set	out	the	following	
goals	for	2023-24:
 ●Based	on	learnings	 from	the	internal	
assessment	 of	the	centralised	 payment	systems	(CPS),	 i.e.,	NEFT	and	RTGS,	
in	compliance	 with	principles	 for	financial	
market	infrastructure	 (PFMI)	standards,	 a	
resilient	framework	 prescribing	 standards, 	
frequency	 and	disclosures	 for	the	oversight	
of	CPS	would	be	formulated	 (Utkarsh 2.0)	
[Paragraph	IX.10];
 ●The	PIDF	has	received	 overwhelming 	
support	 from	the	contributors	 (viz.,  
the	Reserve	 Bank,	card	networks	 and	
card	issuing	banks)	and	acquirers	 for	
deployment	 of	payment	 acceptance 	
infrastructure3.	The	implementation	 of	the	
scheme	threw	up	various	innovative	 ideas	
and	field	level	experiences.	 The	feasibility	
of	continuing	 the	PIDF	scheme	would	be	
explored	(Utkarsh 2.0)	[Paragraph	IX.10];
 ●To	enhance	 the	payment	 experience 	
further,	the	feasibility	 of	real-time	 payee	
name	validation	 before	actual	fund	transfer	
would	be	explored	(Paragraph	 IX.10);	and
 ●To	continue	 with	initiatives	 to	enhance	
dissemination	 of	granular	data	on	payment	
systems	 to	provide	useful	insights	to	
stakeholders	 and	facilitate	research	 and	
further	innovations	 in	payment	 systems	
(Paragraph	IX.10).
Implementation Status
IX.10		The	Reserve	Bank	has	formulated	 a	
standard	operating	 procedure	 (SOP)	for	oversight	
of	CPS,	 i.e.,	NEFT	and	RTGS,	based	on	the	
learnings	 from	the	internal	assessment	 of	CPS	
in	line	with	PFMI	standards.	 As	announced	 in	
the	Statement	 on	Developmental	 and	Regulatory 	
Policies	(October	 6,	2023),	the	PIDF	scheme	
was	extended	 by	a	period	of	two	years,	 i.e.,	up	
3 		The	scheme’s	 initial	target	of	creating	90	lakh	payment	touch	points	by	the	end	of	December	 2023	was	met	by	the	end	of	the	first	year

ANNUAL REPORT 2023-24166to	December	 31,	2025.	The	Reserve	Bank	is	
working	on	the	implementation	 of	the	‘payee	name	
look-up	facility’	in	compliance	 with	newly	enacted	
‘The	Digital	Personal	Data	Protection	 Act,	2023’.	
The	Reserve	Bank	is	also	working	on	enhancing	
coverage	 and	granularity	 of	published	 payment	
transaction	 data,	which	shall	provide	useful	
insights	to	stakeholders	 and	facilitate	research	
and	further	innovations	in	payment	systems.
Major Developments
Integrity
Regulation of Payment Aggregators - Cross 
Border (PAs - Cross Border)
IX.11		PAs-Cross	 Border	are	entities	that	facilitate	
cross-border	 payment	 transactions	 for	import	
and	export	of	permissible	 goods	and	services	in	
online	mode.	Keeping	in	view	the	developments	
that	have	taken	place	in	cross-border	 payments,	 it	
was	decided	to	bring	all	such	entities	under	direct	
regulation	 of	the	Reserve	Bank,	and	guidelines	
for	the	regulation	 of	PAs-Cross	 Border	were	
accordingly	issued	during	the	year.
Creating a Common Corporate Governance 
Structure for RTGS and NEFT
IX.12		A	Standing	Committee	 for	management	
of	CPS	has	been	constituted	 for	providing	
a	structured	 forum	for	continuous	 dialogue	
with	members	 to	create	a	common	 corporate	
governance	 structure	 for	RTGS	and	NEFT	
systems.
Card-on-File Tokenisation (CoFT)4 - Enabling 
Tokenisation Through Card Issuing Banks
IX.13		The	Reserve	 Bank	permitted	 CoFT	
facilities	directly	through	card	issuing	banks/institutions.	 This	will	provide	cardholders	 with	
an	additional	 choice	to	tokenise	their	cards	for	
multiple	merchant	sites	through	a	single	process. 	
Cyber Resilience and Payment Security Controls 
of PSOs
IX.14		The	Reserve	Bank	placed	‘Draft	Master	
Direction	 on	Cyber	Resilience	 and	Payment	
Security	 Controls	 of	PSOs’	on	its	website	
for	comments.	 The	document	 covers	robust	
governance	 mechanisms	 for	identification, 	
analysis,	 monitoring	 and	management	 of	
information	 security,	 including	 cyber	security	
risks	and	vulnerabilities,	 and	baseline	security	
measures	 for	ensuring	 safe	and	secure	digital	
payment	transactions. 
Arrangements with Card Networks for Issue of 
Credit Cards
IX.15		The	Reserve	Bank	asked	card	issuers	
(banks/non-banks),	 with	10	lakh	or	more	active	
cards	issued	by	them,	not	to	enter	into	any	
arrangement	 or	agreement	 with	card	networks	
that	may	limit	their	ability	to	tie-up	with	other	card-
networks.	 They	were	also	mandated	 to	provide	the	
customers	 the	facility	to	choose	among	multiple	
card	networks.
Amendments to Master Direction on PPIs
IX.16		The	Reserve	Bank	permitted	 authorised 	
bank	and	non-bank	 PPI	issuers	to	issue	PPIs	
for	mass	transit	systems	(PPI-MTS)	 for	making	
payments	 across	various	 public	transport	
systems. This	 will	provide	convenience,	 speed,	
affordability	 and	safety	of	digital	modes	of	
payment	to	commuters	for	transit	services.
4	Under	this	framework,	 cardholders	 can	create	“tokens”	(a	unique	alternate	code)	in	lieu	of	card	details.	These	tokens	can	then	be	stored	
by	the	merchants	 for	processing	 transactions	 in	future.	A	token	thus	created	is	specific	to	the	card	and	online/e-commerce	 merchant,	 i.e.,	the	
token	cannot	be	used	for	payment	at	any	other	merchant.

PAYMENT AND SETTLEMENT SYSTEMS AND  
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY167Self-Assessment of RTGS and NEFT Under 
Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures 
(PFMIs)
IX.17		The	centralised	 payment	systems	which	
include	RTGS	and	NEFT,	are	owned	and	operated	
by	the	Reserve	Bank.	To	enhance	the	robustness 	
of	the	centralised	 payment	systems,	 their	self-
assessment	 against	the	PFMIs	was	carried	
out	in	2023-24.	 Such	self-assessments	 will	be	
carried	out	annually	from	2023-24.	Since	RTGS	is	
categorised	 as	a	financial	market	infrastructure,	 a	
public	disclosure	 document	 for	RTGS,	based	on	
the	self-assessment,	 has	been	published	 on	the	
Reserve	Bank’s	website.
Innovation
Interoperable Payment System for Internet 
Banking Transactions
IX.18		Internet	banking	transactions	 processed 	
through	PAs	are	not	interoperable,	 i.e.,	a	bank	
is	required	to	separately	 integrate	 with	each	
PA	of	different	online	merchants.	 As	a	result,	
there	are	delays	in	actual	receipt	of	payments	
by	merchants,	 which	may	result	in	settlement 	
risks.	The	Reserve	 Bank	gave	approval	 for	
implementing	 an	interoperable	 payment	system	
for	internet	banking	transactions	 to	NPCI	 Bharat  
BillPay	Ltd.	(NBBL).	The	new	system	will	facilitate	
quicker	settlement	of	funds	for	merchants.
Financial Inclusion
Expanding the Scope of TReDS
IX.19		The	Reserve	Bank	expanded	 the	scope	
of	activity	in	TReDS	by	permitting	 insurance	 for	
transactions,	 increasing	 the	pool	of	financiers, 	
and	enabling	 secondary	 market	for	factoring  
units	(FUs).	This	will	improve	the	cash	flows	of	
MSMEs.Expanding the Scope and Reach of e-RUPI 
Vouchers
IX.20		The	Reserve	Bank	expanded	 the	scope	
of	e-RUPI	vouchers	 by	permitting	 non-bank	 PPI	
issuers	to	issue	e-RUPI	vouchers,	 enabling	its	
issuance	on	behalf	of	individuals,	 and	modifying	
other	aspects	 like	reloading	 of	vouchers,	
authentication	 process,	 and	issuance	 limits	to	
facilitate	use	of	e-RUPI	vouchers.
Streamlining Bharat Bill Payment System (BBPS) 
Processes and Membership Criteria 
IX.21		The	Reserve	Bank	revised	the	regulatory	
framework	 for	BBPS  in	 view	of	significant	
developments	 that	have	taken	place	in	this	domain.	
This	will	streamline	 the	process	of	bill	payments,	
enable	greater	participation,	 and	enhance	
customer	protection,	among	other	changes.
Inclusion of Pradhan Mantri Vishwakarma Scheme 
Beneficiaries Under PIDF Scheme
IX.22		The	beneficiaries	 identified	 as	part	
of	the Pradhan Mantri Vishwakarma scheme	
across	the	country	were	included	as	merchants	
for	deployment	 under	the	PIDF	scheme.	Other	
contemporary	 devices,	 viz.,	(i)	soundbox	 devices	
and	(ii)	Aadhaar-enabled	biometric	devices,	were	
also	made	eligible	for	subsidy	under	the	scheme.	
The	amount	of	subsidy	for	devices	deployed	 in	
special	focus	areas,	 viz.,	North-Eastern	 states,	
and	Union	Territories	 of	Jammu	&	Kashmir	and	
Ladakh,	was	increased	 from	75	per	cent	to	90	
per	cent	of	the	total	cost,	irrespective	 of	the	type	
of	device,	to	further	accelerate	 and	augment	the	
deployment	 of	payment	acceptance	 infrastructure.
Processing of e-Mandates for Recurring 
Transactions
IX.23		The	Reserve	Bank	enhanced	 the	limit	for	
subsequent	 recurring	 transactions	 undertaken	

ANNUAL REPORT 2023-24168without	additional	factor	of	authentication,	 as	
prescribed	 in	the	e-mandate	 framework,	 from	
₹15,000	to	₹1,00,000	 per	transaction	 for	the	
following	 categories:	 (a)	subscription	 to	mutual	
funds,	(b)	payment	of	insurance	 premia,	and	(c)	
credit	card	bill	payments.
Enhancing UPI Transaction Limit for Specified 
Categories
IX.24		The	Reserve	Bank	enhanced	 the	limit	for	
UPI	payments	 made	to	hospitals	and	educational	
institutions	 from	₹1	lakh	to	₹5	lakh	per	transaction.
Enhancing the Robustness of Aadhaar Enabled 
Payment System (AePS)
IX.25		The	Reserve	Bank	proposed	to	streamline	
the	onboarding	 process,	including	 mandatory	 due	
diligence,	 for	AePS	touchpoint	 operators,	 to	be	
followed	by	banks.	In	2023,	more	than	37	crore	
users	undertook	 AePS	transactions,	 which	points	
to	the	important	 role	played	by	AePS	in	financial	
inclusion.	 Additional	 fraud	risk	management	
requirements	 will	also	be	considered,	 which	will	
enhance	the	robustness	of	the	 AePS.
Merger of Grids Under Cheque Truncation System 
(CTS)
IX.26		To	promote	efficient	cheque	processing,	
the	Reserve	Bank	had	undertaken	 to	migrate	
CTS	from	an	architecture	 of	three	regional	grids	
to	one	national	grid.	The	merger	was	completed	
on	October	13,	2023.	The	merged	grid	has	been	
named	as	National	Grid	Clearing	House	(NGCH)	
and	the	Reserve	Bank,	Chennai	office,	has	been	
designated	 as	the	nodal	office	for	management	
and	oversight	 of	the	operations	 of	the	merged	
grid.	The	merger	has	improved	 liquidity	efficiency	of	the	system	and	has	enabled	rationalisation	 of	
cheque	clearing	infrastructure.	 After	the	merger,	
all	cheques	presented	 through	the	CTS	are	being	
processed	as	local	cheques.
Enhancing Public Awareness through Various 
Channels
IX.27		The	Reserve	Bank	has	been	conducting	
electronic	 banking	 awareness	 and	training	
(e-BAAT)	 programmes	 regularly	 for	the	benefit	
of	various	strata	of	society	across	the	country.	
During	the	year,	340	e-BAAT	programmes	 were	
conducted	 by	the	regional	offices	of	the	Reserve	
Bank,	in	which	safe	usage	of	electronic	 payment	
systems,	 their	benefits	and	grievance	 redressal	
mechanisms	were	explained	to	the	participants.
Digital Payments Awareness Week 2024
IX.28		The	Reserve	Bank	observed	 the	Digital	
Payment	 Awareness	 Week	during	March	4-10,	
2024	with	the	theme	‘Digital	Payment,	 Surakshit 
Payment’	(‘Digital	Payment,	 Safe	Payment’)	 under	
the	mission	‘Har	Payment	Digital’5.	As	part	of	the	
initiative,	all	regional	offices	of	the	Reserve	Bank	
will	start	regional	campaigns	 to	convert	market	
places	like	vegetable	 markets/mandis 	and	public	
transport	infrastructure	 like	auto/taxis	 into	digital	
payment	enabled	clusters	in	their	chosen	areas.
Internationalisation
Global Outreach of Payment Systems
IX.29		The	Payments	 Vision	Document	 2025	has	
outlined	expanding	 the	global	outreach	of	UPI	and	
RuPay	cards	as	one	of	the	key	objectives	 under	
the	internationalisation	 pillar.	The	Reserve	Bank	is	
in	talks	with	central	banks	of	various	countries	for	
entering	into	collaborati ve	arrangements.
5	Launched	on	March	6,	2023.

PAYMENT AND SETTLEMENT SYSTEMS AND  
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY169IX.30		In	July	2023,	the	Reserve	Bank	and	
the	Central	Bank	of	the	UAE	(CBUAE)	 signed	
a	memorandum	 of	understanding	 (MoU)	for	
interlinking	 their	payments	 infrastructure.	 Under	
this	MoU,	the	two	central	banks	agreed,	 inter 
alia,	to	cooperate	 on	linking	their	Fast	Payment	
Systems	 [UPI	of	India	with	Instant	Payment	
Platform	(IPP)	of	UAE	called	 Aani]	and	for	linking	
their	respective	 Card	Switches	(RuPay	switch	and	
UAESWITCH).
IX.31		In	February	 2024,	RuPay	cards	and	
UPI	connectivity	 between	 India	and	Mauritius	
was	launched.	 With	this	connectivity,	 an	Indian	
traveller	to	Mauritius	will	be	able	to	pay	a	merchant	
in	Mauritius	using	UPI	apps.	Similarly,	a	Mauritian	
traveller	will	be	able	to	do	the	same	in	India	using	
the	instant	payment	system	apps	of	Mauritius.	
Further,	with	the	adoption	of	RuPay	technology,	
the	Mauritius	 Central	 Automated	 Switch 
(MauCAS)	 card	scheme	will	enable	banks	in	
Mauritius	to	issue	RuPay	cards	domestically.	 Such	
cards	can	be	used	at	ATMs	and	PoS	terminals	
locally	in	Mauritius	 as	well	as	in	India.	With	this,	
Mauritius	 has	become	the	first	country	outside	
Asia	to	issue	cards	using	RuPay	technology.
IX.32		In	February	 2024,	UPI	connectivity	
between	India	and	Sri	Lanka	was	launched.	 This	
connectivity	 has	enabled	Indian	travellers	to	make	
QR	code-based	 payments	 at	merchant	 locations	
in	Sri	Lanka	using	UPI	apps.
IX.33		The	Reserve	Bank	and	Nepal	Rastra	
Bank	are	actively	exploring	 the	linkage	of	UPI	
platform	of	India	and	National	Payments	 Interface	
of	Nepal	for	enabling	cross-border	 payments.	 In	
June	2023,	NPCI	International	 Payments	 Ltd.	
(NIPL)	and	Nepal	Clearing	House	Ltd.	(NCHL)	
signed	a	MoU	for	the	purpose.Other Initiatives
Digital Payments Index (DPI)
IX.34		The	Reserve	Bank	had	constructed	 a	
composite	 DPI	in	2021	to	capture	the	extent	of	
digitisation	 of	payments	 across	the	country.	The	
RBI-DPI	index	is	computed	 semi-annually	 and	
has	demonstrated	 significant	 growth,	representing	
rapid	adoption	and	deepening	 of	digital	payments	
across	the	country.	The	DPI	increased	 by	10.9	per	
cent	to	418.8	in	September	 2023	from	377.5	in	
September	2022	(Chart	IX.1).	
Inspection of PSOs

ANNUAL REPORT 2023-24170the	Reserve	Bank	during	2023-24.	The	Department	
undertook	 enforcement	 action	against	one	PSO	
for	contraventions/non-compliance	 of	directions	
issued	by	the	Reserve	Bank.
Developments in CCIL
IX.36		The	Reserve	 Bank	and	the	Bank	of	
England	(BoE)	signed	a	MoU	on	December	 1,	
2023,	concerning	 cooperation	 and	exchange	
of	information	 in	relation	to	CCIL.	The	MoU	
establishes	 a	framework	 for	BoE	to	place	
reliance	on	the	Reserve	Bank’s	regulatory	 and	
supervisory	 activities	while	safeguarding	 United	
Kingdom’s	 (UK’s)	financial	stability.	The	MoU	also	
demonstrates	 the	importance	 of	cross-border	
cooperation	 to	facilitate	 international	 clearing	
activities	 and	BoE’s	commitment	 to	defer	to	
other	regulators’ 	regimes,	 besides	confirming	
the	interests	of	both	the	authorities	 in	enhancing	
cooperation	 in	line	with	their	respective	 laws	
and	regulations.	 It	also	enables	BoE	to	assess	
the	application	 of	CCIL	for	recognition	 as	a	third	
country	CCP,	which	is	a	pre-requisite	 for	UK-
based	banks	to	clear	transactions	 through	CCIL.	
Pursuant	to	the	signing	of	the	MoU	on	December	
15,	2023,	BoE	provided	recognition	to	CCIL.
Agenda for 2024-25
IX.37	 In	 2024-25,	the	Department	 will	focus	on	
the	following	goals:	
 ●The	Central	Payments	 Fraud	Information	
Registry	(CPFIR)	reporting	will	be	extended	
to	local	area	banks,	state	cooperative	
banks,	district	cooperative	 banks,	regional	
rural	banks	(RRBs)	and	non-scheduled	
urban	cooperative	 banks	(UCBs)	for	
payment	fraud	reporting	( Utkarsh	2.0);
 ●Presently,	 CTS	has	two	settlements,	 one	for	
presentation	 session	and	other	for	return	session.	 Under	on-realisation	 model,	a	
single	settlement	 would	be	arrived	at	after	
closure	of	return	session	for	net	position	
of	each	bank.	This	is	expected	 to	improve	
liquidity	efficiency	of	the	CTS;
 ●In	light	of	goals	for	Viksit Bharat	 2047,	
the	Reserve	 Bank,	along	with	NPCI	
International	 Payments	 Ltd.	(NIPL)	will	
work	towards	taking	UPI	to	20	countries	
with	initiation	 timeline	of	2024-25	 and	
completion	 timeline	of	2028-29.	 Further,	
Fast	Payment	System	(FPS)	collaboration	
with	group	of	countries	 like	European	
Union	and	South	Asian	Association	 for	
Regional	Cooperation	 (SAARC),	 as	well	as	
multilateral	linkages	will	be	explored;	
 ●At	present,	the	payments	 ecosystem	 (card	
networks/banks/PPI	 entities)	has	largely	
adopted	SMS-based	 one-time	 password	
(OTP)	as	additional	 factor	of	authentication	
(AFA).	However,	 with	the	advancements	
in	technology,	 various	innovative	 solutions	
are	now	available	to	address	the	fraud	and	
friction	in	payments.	 Hence,	an	alternate	
risk-based	 authentication	 mechanism	
leveraging	 behavioural	 biometrics,	 location/
historical	payments,	 digital	tokens,	and	in-
app	notifications	will	be	explored;	and	
 ●Presently,	 centralised	 payment	 systems	
(RTGS	and	NEFT)	rely	only	on	account	
number	and	IFSC	for	transfer	of	funds.	
With	an	aim	to	curb	frauds	and	enhance	
the	payment	 experience	 further,	the	
introduction	 of	real-time	 payee	name	
validation	 before	the	actual	fund	transfer	
will	be	explored	in	compliance	 with	newly	
enacted	 ‘The	Digital	Personal	 Data	
Protection	 Act,	2023’.

PAYMENT AND SETTLEMENT SYSTEMS AND  
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY1713. DEPARTMENT OF INFORMATION 
TECHNOLOGY (DIT)
IX.38		During	the	year,	enhancements	 in	
e-Kuber	and	payment	systems	were	carried	out	
to	meet	the	evolving	business	requirements	 like	
roll-out	of	central	bank	digital	currency	(CBDC),	
reversal	of	facilities	under	liquidity	adjustment	
facility	(LAF)	and	making	NEFT	compliant	 with	
ISO	20022	 standards.	 With	the	objective	 of	digital	
transformation	 of	work	culture	in	the	Reserve	
Bank,	the	Department	 undertook	 a	comprehensive	
revamp	of	major	internal	applications	 of	the	
Reserve	Bank,	 viz.,	Enterprise	 Knowledge	 Portal-
Intranet	(EKP);	 SWAGAT	 (access	management	
system);	 Sarthi (electronic	 document	 management	
system);	 and	SAMWAD	 (video	conferencing	
system).	 EKAMEV	 -	identity	access	management	
(IAM)	and	mobile	device	management	 (MDM)	
were	also	rolled-out	 during	the	year	to	enhance	
the	cyber	security	posture	in	the	Reserve	Bank .
IX.39		Best	practices	in	cyber	hygiene	have	been	
adopted	to	ensure	the	security	of	the	Reserve  
Bank’s	IT	infrastructure,	 consisting	 of	IT 
applications,	 systems,	 networks,	 devices	and	
data,	against	cyber	risks	by	adopting	emerging	
technologies,	 state-of-the-art	 tools,	and	continuous	
monitoring	 of	the	controls.	 The	Department	
continues	 to	collaborate	 with	the	Indian	Computer	
Emergency	 Response	 Team	(CERT-In)	 and	
other	government	 agencies	 like	National	Critical	
Information	 Infrastructure	 Protection	 Centre	
(NCIIPC).	 Based	on	the	advisories	 issued	by	
agencies,	 inputs	from	threat	intelligence	 sources,	
and	continuous	 risk	assessment	 and	monitoring,	
the	security	controls	are	being	upgraded	 on	an	
ongoing	basis,	thus	elevating	 the	defence	against	
cyber	threats.	An	extended	 six-month	 long	cyber-
security	awareness	 drive	across	the	Reserve	
Bank	with	the	overarching	 theme	of	‘Secure	Our	World’	has	also	been	implemented.	 While	the	
construction	 of	the	‘Enterprise	 Computing	 and	
Cybersecurity	 Training	Institute’	is	under	progress	
to	foster	a	safe	and	responsible	 cyber	culture	
within	the	Reserve	Bank,	26	training	programmes	
covering	around	753	officers	from	various	locations	
have	been	conducted	till	March	31,	2024.
IX.40		Further,	in	line	with	the	Payments	 Vision	
Document	 2025,	and	in	order	to	support	the	global	
outreach	 and	expand	the	footprint	of	domestic	
payment	systems,	a	Global	Structured	 Financial	
Messaging	 System	(SFMS)	Hub	project	was	
initiated.	This	would	further	improve	the	efficiency	
of	the	Reserve	Bank’s	payment	system.
Agenda for 2023-24 
IX.41	 The	 Department	 had	set	out	the	following	
goals	for	2023-24:	
 ●The	 e-Kuber	application	 interface	
with	many	important	 stakeholders	
including	 Government	 of	India	and	state	
governments	 needs	to	be	up	to	date	with	
the	latest	technology	 architecture	 to	match	
the	evolving	IT	and	financial	landscape.	
The	 e-Kuber	has	been	designated	 as	a	
Critical	Information	 Infrastructure	 (CII)	
by	the	NCIIPC.	The	upgraded	 e-Kuber  
shall	employ	latest	technologies	 using	
application	 programming	 interfaces	
(APIs),	microservices	 and	containers,	
and	was	expected	 to	be	completed	 for	
implementation	 in	2023-24	(Utkarsh	2.0)	
[Paragraph	IX.42];
 ●The	Reserve	 Bank	has	initiated	 the	
project	to	construct	 a	new	state-of-
the-art	greenfield	 next	generation	 data	
centre	to	address	the	capacity	expansion 	
constraints,	 meet	ever-increasing	 IT	
landscape	 needs	and	avoid	region	

ANNUAL REPORT 2023-24172specific	risks.	The	construction	 of	the	data	
centre	has	commenced	 and	shall	be	in	an	
advanced	 stage	of	completion	 in	2023-24	
(Utkarsh	2.0)	[Paragraph	IX.43];
 ●The	Reserve	 Bank,	in	its	continuous	
endeavour	 to	update	and	upgrade	India’s	
national	payment	systems,	has	planned	to	
upgrade	the	RTGS	system.	This	will	include	
improvements	 in	existing	functionalities	 and	
introduction	 of	several	new	functionalities	
supported	 by	the	RTGS.	The	upgraded	
RTGS	will	take	care	of	the	futuristic	
requirements	 like	scalability,	 enhanced	
security	 and	performance	 (Paragraph	
IX.44);	and
 ●The	Department	 will	be	enhancing	
the	internal	applications	 to	facilitate	 a	
transformation	 towards	 digital	modes	
and	reducing	 dependence	 on	manual	
and	paper-based	 procedures	 in	day-to-
day	work.	Continuous	 improvements	 in	
Sarthi,	a	revamped	 EKP,	improved	 visitor	
management	 system	and	development	
of	a	web	interface	for	regulated	 entities	
to	submit	applications/requests	 has	been	
planned,	which	will	help	bring	about	the	
digital	transformation	 (Paragraph	 IX.45	–	
Paragraph	IX.48).
Implementation Status
IX.42		With	the	vision	of	providing	 best-in-class	
and	environment-friendly	 digital	and	physical	
infrastructure,	 the	Department	 upgraded	 e-Kuber  
to	e-Kuber	2.0	with	the	latest	technology.	 All	the	
participants	 are	now	using	the	upgraded	 version	of	
e-Kuber	online	portal.	The	currency	management	
module	has	also	been	upgraded	 and	is	in	use	by	
various	offices	of	the	Reserve	Bank.	Currency	
chest	(CC)	holding	banks	have	also	started	using	the	upgraded	currency	chest	portal	for	real-time	
reporting	of	CC	related	transactions.
IX.43	 The	 construction	 of	the	data	centre	has	
commenced	 with	the	laying	of	foundation	 stone	by	
the	Governor,	 Reserve	Bank,	on	March	22,	2023.	
The	core	and	shell	construction	 of	the	data	centre	
is	in	the	advanced	 stage	of	completion.	 The	project	
is	expected	 to	be	completed	 within	the	stipulated	
timeline.
IX.44	 The	 Department	 updated	and	upgraded	
RTGS	system	during	2023-24	 with	new 
functionality	 like	Foreign	Contribution	 (Regulation)	
Act	(FCRA)	code	introduction,	 improved	 and	
efficient	automated	 message	flow,	among	 various	
nodes	of	RTGS.	Apart	from	these,	the	security	
features	of	the	system	have	been	upgraded	 in	
terms	of	better	user	management	 control	and	
compatibility	 with	latest	digital	certificates	 issued	
by	the	certifying	 authority,	 viz.,	Institute	for	
Development	 &	Research	 in	Banking	Technology	
(IDRBT).	
IX.45	 The	 Department	 undertook	 a	
comprehensive	 revamp	of	the	EKP,	with	the	new	
EKP	being	a	state-of-the-art,	 interactive	 and	
collaborative	 intranet	portal	with	enhanced	 user	
interface	and	employee	engagement	features.
IX.46		With	the	enhanced 	access	management	
system	christened	 as	‘Seamless	 SWAGAT’,	
the	Department	 is	seeking	to	implement	 facial	
recognition	 for	employee	 access	management	
and	QR	code	technology	 for	visitor	access	
management	 system.	This	technology	 is	presently	
being	developed	 on	a	pilot	basis	at	the	Reserve	
Bank’s	central	office	building,	Mumbai.	This	is	
expected	 to	be	rolled	out	gradually	 in	phases,	
based	on	feedback	and	user	experiences.
IX.47		The	password-less 	authentication	 project	
for	internal	users	of	the	Reserve	 Bank	was	

PAYMENT AND SETTLEMENT SYSTEMS AND  
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY173implemented	 in	two	phases.	Phase	I	enabled	
password-less	 biometric	 (face/fingerprint)	
authentication	 for	desktop	login.	Phase	II	is	identity	
access	management	 (IAM)	solution	christened	 as	
“EKAMEV”,	 a	secure	single	sign-on	(SSO)	portal	
to	enhance	user	experience	 and	security,	while	
accessing	 the	Reserve	Bank’s	web	applications	
by	its	internal	users.
IX.48	   Continuous	 enhancements	 in	Sarthi 
are	also	being	undertaken	 to	improve	 the	
user	experience	 and	a	revamped	 Sarthi	2.0	
is	under	implementation.	 Sarthi 2.0	will	come	
out	with	a	host	of	features,	including	 improved	
user	interface	 (UI)/user	 experience	 (UX),	
mobile	responsiveness,	 knowledge	 repository	
functionality,	 and	integration	 with	Microsoft	Office.
Major Initiatives
Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) 
IX.49		CBDC	(e₹)	has	been	implemented	 in	both	
wholesale	 and	retail	pilot	segments.	 The	use	cases	
of	CBDC	are	still	evolving.	 The	Reserve	Bank	
introduced	 another	use	case	in	the	e₹-Wholesale	
(e₹-W)	pilot	in	October	2023	for	facilitating	 inter-
bank	call	money	trades	using	e₹.	Presently,	 the	
existing	inter-bank	 call	money	trades	are	settled	
using	RTGS.	However,	 with	e₹-W,	banks	can	
settle	the	call	money	trades	in	real	time	in	e-Kuber  
without	involvement	 of	RTGS	application.	 Further,	
the	balances	 of	e₹-W	were	mirrored	with	NPCI	
in	real	time	to	facilitate	migration	 of	e₹-W	to	
distributed	ledger	technology	(DLT)	platform.
‘Just-in-Time’ Release of Centrally Sponsored 
Schemes (CSS) Funds Through e-Kuber 
IX.50		The	project	of	using	 e-Kuber	platform	
for	releasing	 funds	under	CSS	by	Department	 of	
Expenditure,	 Ministry	of	Finance,	 Government	
of	India,	was	implemented,	 wherein	 e-Kuber	is	handling	the	CSS	funds	flow	‘just	in	time’	from	
central	government	 and	state	governments	
to	the	beneficiaries.	 Currently,	 seven	state	
governments	 have	been	onboarded,	 and	other	
state	governments	are	being	onboarded.
Reversal of Facilities under LAF
IX.51	 As	 per	the	Statement	 on	Developmental	
and	Regulatory	 Policies	(December	 8,	2023),	it	
was	proposed	 to	allow	reversal	of	liquidity	facilities	
under	both	Standing	 Deposit	Facility	(SDF)	and	
Marginal	 Standing	 Facility	(MSF)	even	during	
weekends	 and	holidays	with	effect	from	December	
30,	2023,	as	simultaneous	 high	utilisation	 was	
observed	 in	both	MSF	and	SDF.	This	measure	
was	expected	to	facilitate	better	fund	management	
by	the	banks.	Accordingly,	 changes	were	carried	
out	in	e-Kuber core	banking	solution	(CBS)	for	
enabling	 this.	Further,	the	reversal	of	liquidity	
facilities	availed	under	Automated	 Sweep-In	 and	
Sweep-Out	 (ASISO)	facility	for	the	transactions	
over	the	weekends	 and	holidays	were	previously	
carried	out	on	the	next	working	day	at	Mumbai.	
Changes	 were	also	carried	out	in	e-Kuber	to	
facilitate	reversal	of	these	ASISO	transactions	
immediately	 on	next	day	(regardless	 of	whether	
holiday	or	not).
Making NEFT Compliant to ISO 20022 Messaging 
Standards
IX.52		The	NEFT	system	at	the	Reserve	Bank	
has	been	migrated	and	made	compliant	 with	ISO	
20022	messaging	 standards.	 The	process	of	
onboarding	 more	than	230	member	banks	on	ISO	
20022	messaging	 standards	 has	already	started.	
The	migration	 and	onboarding	 of	all	the	member	
banks	is	expected	to	be	completed	 in	early	2024.	
The	adoption	of	ISO	20022	will	provide	structured	
and	granular	data,	improved	analytics,	 end-to-end	
automation,	 and	better	global	harmonisation.	 It	

ANNUAL REPORT 2023-24174will	also	pave	the	way	for	interoperability	 between	
RTGS	and	NEFT.
Continuous Upgradation of IT and Cyber Security 
IX.53		The	Department	 strives	to	continuously	
assess	and	upgrade	the	IT	security	infrastructure	
to	enhance	 its	efficiency	 and	effectiveness	 of	
tackling	the	emergent	 threats	and	protect	its	
IT	infrastructure	 that	caters	to	critical	payment	
infrastructure.	 Towards	 this	endeavour,	 the	
Department	 upgraded	 ‘Security	 Automation,	
Threat	Analysis	 and	Response	 Centre	
(SATARC):	 Next	Generation	 Security	Operation	
Centre	(NGSOC)’ 	with	innovative	 capabilities	
and	additional	 advancements	 like	security	
orchestration,	 automation	 and	response,	 user	
entity	behaviour	 analytics,	 extended	detection	and	
response.
IX.54		During	the	year,	the	Department	 further	
strengthened	 its	security	posture	by	availing	the	
services	of	an	offensive	 security	platform,	which	
is	used	for	proactive	 defence	and	automatic	
continuous	 fine-tuning	 of	multiple	security	devices/
software,	 including	 policies	pertaining	 to	the	
Reserve	Bank’s	networks,	 systems,	applications,	
and	endpoints.	 The	platform	provides	 security	
assessments	 which	simulate	 real	time	attack	
scenarios	 in	a	controlled	 environment	 to	identify	
the	security	gaps	and	enable	further	fine-tuning	 of	
the	systems	based	on	the	assessment	results.
Private Cloud Infrastructure Augmentation
IX.55		The	Department	 initiated	the	process	of	
augmentation	 of	its	private	cloud	infrastructure	
(viz.,	virtualised	 compute,	 memory	and	storage)	
to	increase	the	capacity	of	the	existing	clusters	
and	replace	servers	reaching	end	of	support.	The	
added	capacity	will	host	next	generation	 core	
banking	solution	(CBS)	application	 (e-Kuber	3.0)	
as	well	as	additional	 non-payment	 applications	 in	the	pipeline.	The	Reserve	Bank’s	private	cloud	
provides	 additional	 benefits	 like	centralised	
management	 of	servers,	scalability,	 and	reduction	
in	the	overhead	costs	for	application	hosting.
Centralised Digital Application Receipts and 
Tracking System 
IX.56		A	secured	web-based	 centralised	 portal	
named	as	PRAVAAH	 (Platform	 for	Regulatory	
Application,	 Validation	 And	AutHorisation)	 has	
been	developed	 to	simplify	and	streamline	 the	
process	 of	submitting	 applications	 seeking	
licence/authorisation/regulatory	 approvals	 from 
the	Reserve	 Bank	under	various	statutes/
regulations.	 By	end-to-end	 digitisation	 of	the	entire	
processing	 lifecycle	of	applications,	 it	will	bring	
greater	efficiencies	 into	regulatory	 processes	 and	
facilitate	ease	of	doing	business	for	the	regulated	
entities	(REs).	The	portal	will	show	time	limits	for	
deciding	 on	the	applications/approvals	 sought	
and	real-time	status	updates	shall	be	provided	to	
the	applicant.	PRAVAAH	 has	been	designed	 with	
dynamic	form-building	 capabilities	 to	enable	the	
regulatory	 departments	 to	easily	create/modify	 the	
template	of	online	forms	as	and	when	required.	
The	filled	forms	along	with	relevant	documents	
will	flow	to	Sarthi (the	Reserve	Bank’s	internal	
electronic	 workflow	 application),	 for	internal	
processing	 by	the	concerned	 departments.	
Features	for	seeking	additional	 information	 from	
the	applicants	 and	replying	to	the	applicant	 will	
also	be	available	in	the	portal	obviating	the	need	
to	send	e-mails/letters.
Revamping of Video Conference 
IX.57	 The	 Department	 has	undertaken	 the	
SAMWAD	 (Secure	Audio-Video	 Meetings	 With	
Advanced	 Devices)	 project	under	which	the	
existing	video	conferencing 	(VC)	system	installed	
in	the	Reserve	Bank	is	being	revamped.	 The	

PAYMENT AND SETTLEMENT SYSTEMS AND  
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY175project	entails	a	uniform,	standardised	 and	state-
of-the-art	 audio-video	 and	VC	system	across	
offices	of	the	Reserve	 Bank.	The	revamped	
system	provides	advanced	features	such	as	active	
speaker	tracking	functionality,	 native	4K	resolution	
display	units,	and	capacity	augmentation	 across	
centralised	 servers	for	more	concurrent	 meetings.	
The	implementation	of	the	project	is	underway.
Agenda for 2024-25
IX.58	 The	 Department’s	 goals	for	2024-25	are	
set	out	below:
 ●The	Reserve	 Bank	has	initiated	the	
project	to	construct	 a	new	state-of-the-art	
greenfield	 next	generation 	data	centre	to	address	the	capacity	expansion	 constraints,	
meet	ever-increasing	 IT	landscape	 needs	
and	avoid	region	specific	risks.	The	data	
centre,	which	is	envisaged 	to	cater	to	the	
internal	needs	of	the	Reserve	Bank	and	its	
subsidiary	 organisations,	 shall	commence	
its	operations	in	2024-25	( Utkarsh 2.0);	
 ●To	enhance	 the	security,	 integrity,	
and	privacy	of	Indian	financial	 sector	
data,	cloud	facility	will	be	set	up	and	 
initially	operated	 by	the	IFTAS.	This	
cloud	facility	is	intended	to	be	rolled	out	
in	a	calibrated	 fashion	in	the	medium-
term	(Box	IX.2);
Indian	Financial	 Technology	 and	Allied	Services	(IFTAS),	
a	wholly	owned	subsidiary	 of	the	Reserve	 Bank,	has	
more	than	eight	years	of	experience	 in	running	its	own	
cloud	platform	and	providing	 various	cloud	services.	 This	
platform	was	put	in	place	for	hosting	the	projects	of	IFTAS,	
the	Reserve	Bank,	and	its	subsidiaries	 for	SFMS	member	
interface.
As	Indian	banks	and	financial	 entities	deal	with	ever	
increasing	 volume	of	data	and	look	at	options	of	various	
public	and	private	cloud	facilities,	it	becomes	imperative	 for	
them	to	carry	out	a	comprehensive	 business	 technology 	
risk	assessment	 for	the	cloud	service	providers	 (CSPs)	
before	availing	their	services.	 Moreover,	 issues	such	
as	enforceability	 of	agreements	 and	adherence	 to	the	
global	standards,	 including	 aspects	of	storage,	integrity,	
protection,	 and	confidentiality	 of	data	have	also	become	
relevant.	In	such	a	scenario,	the	Indian	Banking	Community 	
Cloud	(IBCC),	as	a	one	stop	solution	in	terms	of	expertise	
and	counsel	of	an	experienced	 partner	to	provide	support	
at	every	step	of	the	process,	will	be	beneficial	 to	banks/
financial	institutions	 (FIs),	especially	 the	smaller	ones.	Such	
a	cloud	will	also	allay	any	concerns	in	respect	of	jurisdiction 	
and	address	issues	of	sovereignty,	 integrity,	protection,	 and	Box IX.2
Cloud Facility for India’s Financial Sector
confidentiality	 of	data.	Accordingly,	 the	Reserve	Bank	in	
its	Statement	 on	Developmental	 and	Regulatory	 Policies	
(December	 8,	2023)	announced	 the	setting	up	of	a	cloud	
facility	for	the	financial	sector,	initially	to	be	operated	 by	
IFTAS	and	later,	to	be	transferred	 to	a	separate	 entity.	
The	proposed	 cloud	platform	is	expected	 to	be	at	par	in	
technology	 with	leading	public	cloud	service	providers. 	
The	cloud	platform	will	provide	on-demand	 scalability 	
with	clustered	 high	availability,	 disaster	recovery	with	high	
recovery	time	objective	(RTO)	and	recovery	point	objective	
(RPO),	while	maintaining	 high	degree	of	security,	integrity	
and	privacy	of	data.
Considering	 that	the	cloud	platform	will	cater	to	the	Indian	
financial	system,	a	governance	 framework	 will	be	put	
in	place	for	regulatory	 and	security	compliances.	 The	
framework	 will	also	define	the	onboarding	 requirements.	 A	
cloud	vertical	as	an	independent	 focused	operating	 unit	will	
be	formed	within	IFTAS	with	allocation	 of	various	teams,	
including	cloud	strategy	and	governance,	 cloud	architects, 	
tech	admin	support	teams,	cloud	operations	 and	alerts	
monitoring	 teams,	security	teams,	finance	and	accounting, 	
sales	and	marketing,	 legal	and	contracting	 teams.	The	cloud	
services	will	be	rolled	out	in	a	phased	manner	considering 	
(Contd.)

ANNUAL REPORT 2023-24176 ●The	Indian	Financial	 Network	(INFINET) 	
is	the	communication	 backbone	 for	the	
Indian	banking	and	financial	 sector.	It	
is	a	closed	user	group	(CUG)	network	
for	exclusive	 use	of	member	banks	and	
financial	institutions.	 The	INFINET	runs	the	
critical	payment	system	applications	 such	
as	RTGS,	NEFT	and	 e-Kuber.	 INFINET	
3.0	seeks	to	refresh	the	existing	INFINET	
2.0	with	better	technology,	 bandwidth, 	
and	overall	services.	 It	is	proposed	 to	
be	built	with	the	latest	software-defined 	
wide	area	network	(SD-WAN)	 technology. 	 
The	features	 proposed	 under	SD-
WAN	include	effective	 load	balancing	
of	the	links,	voice	and	video	traffic	 
optimisation	 and	application	 aware	routing.	
SD-WAN	 also	provides	 for	centralised 	
management	 of	the	network	and	zero

 ●The	Reserve	Bank,	in	its	bid	to	take	the	
Indian	Rupee	(INR)	on	global	platform	at	
greater	pace,	has	conceptualised	 a	solution	
wherein	 India’s	domestic	 messaging 	
system	SFMS	would	be	extended	 through	
a	Global	SFMS	Hub	to	other	countries. 	
The	interested	 countries	 can	connect	their	
local	messaging	 system	to	Global	SFMS	Hub	for	cross-border	 payment	messaging 	
in	their	local	currencies.	 This	may	help	
India	in	reducing	 dependence	 on	other	
major	trading	currencies	 and	may	help	in	
foreign	exchange	management; and
 ●To	support	the	‘AatmaNirbhar Bharat’  
initiative	of	the	country,	the	Department 	
plans	to	develop	the	following	applications 	
in-house	to	reduce	external	dependencies 	
(including	 vendors),	 besides	providing	
increased	 flexibility	 in	terms	of	carrying	
out	changes	in	the	system	by	providing	full

4. CONCLUSION
IX.59	 The	 Reserve	 Bank	continued	 its	
efforts	to	develop	 state-of-the-art	 payment	and	settlement	 systems	in	the	country	through	
launch	of	several	initiatives	 during	the	year	
in	line	with	Payments	 Vision	Document	 2025	
across	anchor	goalposts	 of	integrity,	inclusion,	
innovation	 and	internationalisation.	 During	
the	year,	possibilities	 were	also	explored	 for	
increasing	 the	global	footprints	 of	UPI	and	RuPay.	
Besides,	enhancements	 in	e-Kuber	and	payment	
systems,	a	revamp	of	major	internal	applications 	
of	the	Reserve	Bank	was	also	undertaken.	 Best	
practices	 in	cyber	hygiene	have	been	adopted	
to	ensure	the	security	of	the	Reserve	Bank’s	IT	
infrastructure.	 The	initiative	towards	setting-up	 of	a	
cloud	facility	has	commenced	 to	enhance	security,	
integrity,	and	privacy	of	Indian	financial	sector.	
Going	forward,	a	state-of-the-art	 greenfield	 next	
generation	 data	centre	would	be	operationalised 	
to	address	the	capacity	expansion	 constraints, 	
meet	ever-increasing	 IT	landscape	 needs	and	
avoid	region	specific	risks. 	

ANNUAL REPORT 2023-24178COMMUNICATION, INTERNATIONAL 
RELATIONS, RESEARCH AND  
STATISTICSX
X.1 During 2023-24, the Reserve 
Bank’s communication policy, based on the 
principles of relevance, transparency, clarity, 
comprehensiveness and timeliness, remained 
focused on anchoring of the expectations of 
the public with the objective of enhancing the 
effectiveness of policy actions. The Reserve Bank 
strengthened economic and financial relations 
with international organisations and multilateral 
bodies, and effectively articulated India’s 
position at various international fora. Measures 
were initiated for an efficient government cash 
management system through gradual onboarding 
of all stakeholders on the integrated platform. 
Prudent principles of forex reserve management 
(viz., safety, liquidity, and return) were followed. 
Research studies were undertaken on a wide 
range of contemporary macroeconomic and 
financial issues to provide effective and timely 
analytical inputs for policy formulation. Information 
management system was further strengthened 
through development of the next generation 
data warehouse [viz., centralised information 
management system (CIMS)]. The year also 
witnessed a number of amendments/introduction 
of legislations pertaining to the financial sector.
X.2 Against this backdrop, the rest of the 
chapter is divided into eight sections. Section 2 presents major initiatives of the Reserve Bank 
with regard to its communication policy and 
processes. Section 3 discusses the Reserve 
Bank’s international relations, including 
interactions with international organisations 
and multilateral bodies. Section 4 deals with 
the activities of the Reserve Bank as a banker 
to governments and banks. Section 5 analyses 
the conduct of foreign exchange reserves 
management. Section 6 focuses on research 
activities, including statutory reports and frontline 
research publications. Section 7 outlines the 
activities of the Department of Statistics and 
Information Management (DSIM), whereas 
Section 8 presents the activities of the Legal 
Department. Concluding observations are 
provided in the last section.
2. COMMUNICATION PROCESSES
X.3 The centrality of communication in 
the strategy toolkit of a central bank has 
attained growing significance in maintaining 
macroeconomic and financial stability in an 
environment of protracted geopolitical tensions 
and global volatility spillovers. Given the 
key role of expectations in shaping actual 
outcomes, effective communications by the 
central bank can strengthen the efficacy of its 
policy measures and foster price and financial During 2023-24, the Reserve Bank maintained transparency, clarity and timeliness in its communications. 
India’s G20 Presidency was conducted to a successful conclusion. The Reserve Bank also persevered with efforts 
towards bringing more efficiency in the government’s cash management system, and the sound management 
of foreign exchange reserves. Economic policy analysis and research and information management systems were 
further refined to strengthen policy inputs. Legislative initiatives and amendments were pursued to strengthen 
the legal framework necessary for a stable and vibrant financial sector .

COMMUNICATION, INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS,  
RESEARCH AND STATISTICS179stability. Apart from mainstream media, websites 
and speeches, central banks continued using 
innovative methods through social media, 
multimedia and direct engagement with the 
public. Globally, while monetary policy related 
communication dominated mainstream media 
headlines during 2023-24 due to elevated level 
of global inflation, supervisory concerns in select 
advanced economies also underlined the need 
for prompt and timely communication to prevent 
amplification of one-off incidents through social 
media. Heightened vigil acquires significance for 
central banks in the age of social media to pre-
empt spread of misinformation through proactive 
two-way communication channel.
X.4 During the year, the Reserve Bank’s 
structured communication on the website and 
social media platforms was supplemented 
by verbal communication through speeches 
and interviews by top management, press 
conferences, and informal media interactions 
and media workshops. The Reserve Bank’s 
communication strategy encompasses the 
specialised audience dominated by regulated 
entities and financial markets as well as a much 
more diversified audience, who are connected 
directly through social media. Communication in 
non-technical and easy to comprehend manner 
has not only made it more effective, but also 
helped in building public trust and anchored the 
expectations of the public. 
X.5 The Reserve Bank in its role as a full-
service central bank, also conducted 360-degree 
public awareness campaigns (PACs) under the 
‘RBI Kehta Hai’ and ‘RBI Says’ banners. The 
focus of these campaigns - executed across 
print, digital, television (TV), short-messaging-
service (SMS), out-of-home (OOH), social media, sports programmes and other high-impact shows 
- is to create awareness on new initiatives of the 
Reserve Bank, alert people against fraudulent 
players/schemes and improve financial literacy. 
The campaigns under the overarching theme 
of ‘RBI Kehta Hai… Jaankaar Baniye, Satark 
Rahiye’ (RBI Says… Be Aware, Be Alert) aim 
to protect customers from usurious practices 
and unregistered players, along with making 
them aware of their rights. These campaigns are 
customised in 14 different languages and target 
all sections of the society.
Agenda for 2023-24
X.6 The Department had set out the following 
goals for 2023-24:
 ●Completion of impact assessment of 
the Reserve Bank’s public awareness 
campaigns (Utkarsh 2.0) [Paragraph X.7];
 ●Launch of redesigned website, capable 
of communicating effectively with all 
stakeholders (Utkarsh 2.0) [Paragraph

 ●Completion of the second phase of ‘The 
RBI Museum’ at Kolkata (Utkarsh 2.0) 
[Paragraph X.8].
Implementation Status
X.7 The Reserve Bank completed the impact 
assessment analysis of the public awareness 
campaigns in May 2023. The learnings from the 
assessments are being used for fine-tuning the 
strategy for public awareness campaigns. The 
Reserve Bank’s website has been revamped 
to provide a more organised and user-friendly 
interface. The redesign and development of 
the Reserve Bank’s new website and mobile 
application has been completed and the same 

ANNUAL REPORT 2023-24180has been launched for all the stakeholders on 
April 5, 2024.
X.8 The setting up of the second phase of 
‘The RBI Museum’ at Kolkata, depicting the role 
and functions of the Reserve Bank, has been 
completed. The museum was inaugurated and 
dedicated to the nation on December 12, 2023, 
by Shri M. Rajeshwar Rao, Deputy Governor, 
RBI. The innovative exhibits in ‘The RBI 
Museum’ comprise a wide array of interactive 
tools. The Museum elucidates the concept of 
money, its evolution and role in the economy, 
currency behaviour of the public, and continuing 
importance of gold in the society, in an interactive 
fashion (Box X.1). As on March 31, 2024, the Museum had over 35,270 visitors since its 
inception. 
Major Developments
X.9 During 2023-24, Department of 
Communication (DoC) disseminated customised 
communication using various media, viz., TV, 
print, radio, digital, OOH, SMS and cinema in 12 
major regional languages apart from Hindi and 
English (Table X.1). 
X.10  Apart from these thematic customised 
campaigns, the Reserve Bank participated in high 
impact events/programmes like the Indian Premier 
League (IPL), Kaun Banega Crorepati (KBC), 
Asian Games, and International Cricket Council 
A museum acts as a treasure house of knowledge, which 
preserves the culture and history of a country/organisation 
and also acts as an important mode of communication. 
Central banks’ museums are aimed to communicate their 
role and functions to the common public. Understanding 
this importance, many central banks have developed their 
own museums for depicting history; evolution and functions; 
displaying the currencies used by the country; and their 
public awareness and financial literacy initiatives. These 
include: Banco Central do Brasil (Banco Central Museum), 
Bank of England (Bank of England Museum), Bank of Italy 
(Money Museum), Bank of Japan (Currency Museum), 
Bank of Russia (The Bank of Russia Museum), Deutsche 
Bundesbank (Money Museum), Federal Reserve (Money 
Museum), Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) [MAS 
Gallery], and Reserve Bank of Australia (The Reserve 
Bank of Australia Museum). These museums depict the 
currencies, coins and other monetary instruments, the 
history of the central bank and its functions, knowledge 
about money, and the evolution of currency. 
The Reserve Bank of India has three museums, viz., (i) 
The RBI museum at Kolkata; (ii) The Monetary museum 
at Mumbai; and (iii) The RBI Archives museum at Pune. 
While the museum at Mumbai mainly exhibits collection of Box X.1
Central Bank Museums
banknotes and coins from different eras, the museum at 
Pune showcases rich collection of documents pertaining to 
the Reserve Bank’s journey through the years. 
‘The RBI Museum’ at Kolkata is the Reserve Bank’s first full-
fledged museum, which has artefacts on currency, exhibits 
of the evolution of central banking in India, the Reserve Bank 
and its functions, financial literacy and public awareness 
messages. Phase I of ‘The RBI Museum’ was opened to 
the public in March 2019, which depicts fascinating stories 
of money, gold and the genesis of the Reserve Bank. 
The museum also has an interactive gaming zone, which 
facilitates financial learning among young visitors. Phase II 
of ‘The RBI Museum’ at Kolkata depicts various functions 
of the Reserve Bank of India through 75 innovative exhibits 
comprising electronic flipbooks, interactive electronic panels, 
radio frequency identification (RFID) censor-based exhibits, 
mural displays, interactive games, holographic displays, 
dioramas and artefacts. ‘The RBI Museum’ at Kolkata 
uses social media extensively for taking its messaging and 
information to the public. It has a very active presence on 
the Facebook page - therbimuseum and Instagram page of 
RBI - @reservebankofindia.

Implementation Status
X.20 The G20 Finance Track of the Indian 
Presidency accorded primacy to the broad 
themes of digitalisation, concerns of the Global 
South, and climate change with priorities cutting 
across various working groups. The Reserve Bank  
actively engaged with the Ministry of Finance 
(MoF), GoI, to pilot the work on several G20 
Finance Track priorities under financial sector 
issues (FSI), international financial architecture 
(IFA), and on global partnership for financial 
inclusion (GPFI). This also involved close 
collaboration with IOs such as the FSB, the BIS, 
the IMF and the OECD. The Department prepared 
an e-Compendium on G20 Finance Track events 
under the India Presidency, titled ‘G20 Finance 
Track – Finance Ministers and Central Bank 
Governors: Memories and Outcomes’.
X.21 The GPFI prioritised leveraging digital 
public infrastructure (DPI) to enhance financial 
inclusion and productivity, in addition to  
completion of the Financial Inclusion Action Plan 
(FIAP) 2020, that focused on digital financial 
inclusion and finance for small and medium 
enterprises (SMEs). The FIAP 2023 was prepared 
with emphasis on moving towards quality access 
in place of basic access to financial services. X.22 In the international financial architecture 
working group (IFA WG), the Reserve Bank 
piloted the work on (i) assessing macro-financial 
implications of central bank digital currencies 
(CBDCs); (ii) strengthening financial resilience 
through sustainable capital flows; and (iii) 
strengthening the global financial safety net 
(GFSN). 
X.23 Under the FSI, the Reserve Bank piloted 
the G20 Presidency priorities on (i) interoperability 
of national fast payment systems for seamless 
flow of funds; (ii) strengthening financial 
institutions’ ability to manage third-party risks 
and outsourcing, inter alia, concerning BigTech 
and FinTech; and (iii) a reporting framework to 
strengthen financial sectors’ cyber resilience. 
X.24 Adhering to a people-centric approach, 
the Reserve Bank took the lead in organising “Jan 
Bhagidari ” (people’s participation) and domestic 
events to enhance public awareness about 
India’s G20 Presidency Finance Track priorities. 
The Reserve Bank also organised several side-
events on the Presidency priorities alongside the 
G20 ministerial and working group meetings. In 
addition, a national level event on G20 priorities 
of the IFA and framework working group (FWG) 
was organised on August 11, 2023 in Mumbai. 
The G20 Leaders’ Summit took place in New 
Delhi during September 9-10, 2023, concluding 
with the adoption of the New Delhi Leaders’ 
Declaration (NDLD). 
X.25 The IMF concluded the 16th General 
Review of Quotas (GRQ). On December 15, 
2023, its Board of Governors (BoG) approved 
an increase in members’ quotas by 50 per cent 
(SDR 238.6 billion or US$ 320 billion), which 
would bring total quotas of the IMF to SDR 715.7 
billion (US$ 960 billion).  The increased quotas 
would be allocated to the members in proportion 

ANNUAL REPORT 2023-24184to their existing quota shares. India’s quota 
would increase to SDR 19.67 billion (US$ 25.9 
billion3). The 16th GRQ also envisages that once 
quota increases are in effect, Bilateral Borrowing 
Agreements (BBAs) would end and the New 
Arrangements to Borrow (NAB) would be reduced 
to maintain the IMF’s current lending capacity.  
X.26 The Department provided inputs for the 
Fund-Bank meetings of the International Monetary 
and Financial Committee (IMFC) held in April and 
October 2023. The Department facilitated the 
completion of the IMF’s Article IV consultations 
held in September 2023. India’s 2023 Article 
IV Consultation Staff Report was published on 
December 18, 2023.
X.27 When the FSAP program began in 1999, 
assessments were voluntary. In 2010, the IMF 
made it mandatory for 25 jurisdictions, including 
India with systemically important financial sectors 
to undergo FSAP assessments every five years. 
The work relating to FSAP 2024 for India has 
been initiated. 
X.28 BRICS central banks successfully 
conducted a Contingent Reserve Arrangement 
(CRA) test run involving a liquidity instrument 
delinked from the IMF programme with payments 
in alternate currencies and an actual transfer 
of funds. The success of the test-run was a 
significant step in confirming the operational 
readiness of the BRICS CRA. The BRICS 
central banks continued their engagements with 
multiple knowledge sharing activities and study 
reports under various work streams, viz., BRICS 
Economic Bulletin, information security, payment 
systems and transition finance.X.29 A bilateral swap agreement was signed 
by the Reserve Bank with the Royal Monetary 
Authority of Bhutan (RMAB) under the SAARC 
currency swap framework. The meeting of the 
6th Joint Technical Coordination Committee 
(JTCC) between the Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) 
and the Reserve Bank was held on November 
28, 2023. The Reserve Bank supported SAARC 
central banks through technical assistance in 
various central banking areas including monetary 
policy and payment systems and by granting 
SAARCFINANCE scholarships for higher studies. 
The Senior Level Dialogue (SLD) between the 
Bank of Japan (BoJ) and the Reserve Bank was 
held on March 1, 2024.

 ●Implementing payments under the centrally 
sponsored schemes (CSS) in phases 
through integration between e-Kuber and 
government system (Paragraph X.38).Implementation Status
X.38 SNA-SPARSH5 for release of CSS 
funds through an integrated framework of public  
financial management system (PFMS), state 
integrated financial management and information 
system (IFMIS) and e-Kuber system of the 
Reserve Bank was implemented during the year 
(Box X.2). As on March 31, 2024, seven state 
5 Single Nodal Agency - Samayochit Pranali Akikrut Sheeghra Hastantaran (SNA-SPARSH) is a real time system of integrated quick 
transfers.
6 Rajasthan, Karnataka, Odisha, Telangana, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Bihar and Assam.The Reserve Bank, in coordination with governments 
(centre and states) has been taking various initiatives 
for increasing efficiency in government payments, while 
applying the principle of ‘Just-in-Time’ release of funds 
to the extent possible to bring about more efficiency in 
government’s cash management system. SNA-SPARSH is 
another alternative fund flow mechanism for releasing CSS 
funds at both centre and state levels through an integrated 
framework. The Department of Expenditure, Ministry of 
Finance, Government of India, had prescribed guidelines 
for SNA-SPARSH on July 13, 2023, the salient features of 
which are as under:
•	The Reserve Bank functions as primary banker to the 
governments without involvement of agency bank;
•	Ministry/Department concerned of the Government of 
India shall open a drawing account with the Reserve 
Bank under the existing User Defined Customer 
Hierarchy (UDCH) code;
•	State government will designate a single nodal agency 
(SNA) for implementing each state linked scheme (SLS) 
corresponding to a CSS. State government shall open 
SLS-wise drawing accounts of SNA in the Reserve Bank;
•	At the beginning of a financial year, the Ministries/
Departments will create a ‘mother sanction’ in PFMS 
for a state for a CSS. The ‘mother sanction’ will define 
state-wise drawing limit of the Ministry/Department for 
that CSS;Box X.2
Initiatives for Ushering in Efficiency in Government Payment - Implementation of CSS
•	State government will share the consolidated (centre 
plus state share) payment file with PFMS for advance 
release of central share after which, the Ministry/
Department concerned will generate sanction for the 
transfer of central share of funds from centre’s drawing 
account to the state’s drawing account. Relevant details 
of sanction will be informed by PFMS to e-Kuber  in the 
form of an e-payment file. Thus, state’s drawing account 
shall be pre-funded with central share. After release 
of central share of funds, the ‘mother sanction’ for the 
centre’s drawing account for the scheme for the state will 
be reduced by an equivalent amount;
•	
Upon receipt of central share, the consolidated payment 
file will be auto pushed from state treasury system to 
e-Kuber, which will debit the state’s drawing amount 
by the total amount of the payment file and release 
payments to vendors/beneficiaries as per the instructions 
contained in the payment file. The e-Kuber will share the 
debit notification of this payment with both PFMS and 
state IFMIS; and
•	Funds will remain in respective consolidated funds and 
will be released to the beneficiaries/vendors ‘Just-in-
Time’.
Six schemes and ten states6 have been identified by 
the Ministry of Finance, Government of India as at end-
December 2023 for pilot run of the project.

Initiatives for Bringing in Efficiency in Government 
Reporting Systems
X.39 During the year, one state government 
went live for the functionality of receiving clearance 
memo and fax message reports in XML7 format 
through Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP). 
With this, three state governments (viz., West 
Bengal, Tamil Nadu and Punjab) are now live for 
this functionality.
Stabilisation of Government Initiatives Already 
Undertaken
X.40 As part of the endeavour by the Reserve 
Bank to continuously upgrade and enhance 
the process of government banking by way of 
integration of various government payments 
and receipts with the Reserve Bank’s e-Kuber 
system during the year, the Tax Information 
Network (TIN 2.0), which replaced the Online Tax 
Accounting System (OLTAS) with enhancements 
and modifications, has stabilised. The integration 
of state governments and union territories (UTs) 
with the Reserve Bank’s system for processing 
of online Memorandum of Error (MoE) cases 
related to goods and services tax (GST) was 
taken forward by including the states of Goa and 
West Bengal in the list of states integrated for the 
same, while user acceptance testing process is 
underway for the state of Meghalaya and two UTs 
(Delhi and Lakshadweep). Appointment of Agency Banks
X.41 The Reserve Bank has entered into 
agreements with scheduled commercial banks 
(SCBs) as its agents as per Section 45 of the RBI 
Act, 1934, which provides for the appointment of 
banks as agents at all places or at any place in 
India, for purposes that the Reserve Bank may 
specify. During the year, a foreign bank working 
as a wholly owned subsidiary in India was also 
appointed as an agency bank, thereby increasing 
the total number of agency banks to 33.
Initiatives for Interaction with all Stakeholders for 
Exchange of Feedback 
X.42  A meeting was organised with the officials 
of Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General 
of India and all the Accountant Generals of states/
UTs at New Delhi on September 22, 2023, which 
was the first such initiative by the Reserve Bank. 
Similarly, a meeting was organised with the 
government business heads of the 33 agency 
banks, and stakeholders from select states at 
New Delhi on December 1, 2023. These meetings 
were conducted for enabling broader discussions 
amongst the various stakeholders to resolve past 
pending issues, and steps to be followed by the 
agency banks for integrating with the Reserve 
Bank’s e-Kuber system for various business 
processes.
Agenda for 2024-25
X.43 The Department proposes the following 
agenda for 2024-25:
 ●Implementation of centrally sponsored 
schemes through integration of e-Kuber  
with government system for the notified 
states (Utkarsh 2.0).

ANNUAL REPORT 2023-241885.  MANAGING FOREIGN EXCHANGE 
RESERVES
X.44 The reserve management function 
continued to be challenging with increased 
geopolitical risks and financial market volatility. 
The sequence of synchronised global monetary 
tightening in 2022-2023 impacted fixed income 
investors, leading to valuation adjustments. The 
expected cuts in policy rates by central banks in 
2024 and other policy calibrations could bring 
new dynamics to risks and rewards in conducting 
investment operations of portfolio manager.
X.45 In sync with the broader principles of 
reserve management (viz., safety, liquidity and 
return), the Department of External Investments 
and Operations (DEIO) continued to operate in 
that order for the management of foreign exchange 
reserves (FER). The FER increased by 11.7 per 
cent during 2023-24 as against a decrease of  
4.7 per cent during 2022-23. The Department  
also sustained its endeavour to ensure 
diversification of forex reserves by exploring 
new asset classes/jurisdictions for deployment of 
foreign currency asset (FCA) as per its defined 
policy objectives. 
Agenda for 2023-24
X.46 The Department had set out the following 
goals for 2023-24:
 ●To ensure effective execution of the reserve 
management functions by implementing 
the Next Generation Treasury Application 
(NGTA) [Utkarsh 2.0] (Paragraph X.47); ●As part of the Reserve Bank’s quest 
for enhancing the role of the Indian 
Rupee (INR) globally, and given the 
Department’s unique position in assessing 
the international economic and monetary 
environment, it would work towards  
further internationalisation of the INR. 
Further, the Department would promote the 
use of INR and other domestic currencies 
in the Asian Clearing Union (ACU) 
mechanism (Utkarsh 2.0) [Paragraph 
X.48-X.49]; and
 ●Continue to actively manage the forex 
reserves and adopt strategies for 
enhancing returns, while conforming to the 
broad objectives of reserve management 
(Paragraph X.50).
Implementation Status 
X.47 The Department is in the process of 
implementing NGTA and made progress during 
the year. 
X.48 Out of short-term goals identified in the 
report of the Inter Departmental Group (IDG) on 
internationalisation of INR, partial achievements 
in implementation of the recommendations have

CIMS; providing query and visualisation 
tools; onboarding all the regulated entities; 
and decommissioning old systems 
[centralised database management 
system (CDBMS) and an eXtensible 
business reporting language (XBRL) 
portal] (Paragraph X.65);
 ●Extending the Reserve Bank’s regular 
household surveys to rural and semi-urban 
areas (Utkarsh 2.0) [Paragraph X.66];
 ●Refining data quality for banking returns 
using artificial intelligence (AI)/machine 
learning (ML) techniques (Utkarsh 2.0) 
[Paragraph X.66]; and
 ●Building additional high-frequency 
indicators of economic activity by using 
non-traditional data (Paragraph X.66).
Implementation Status
X.65 The Reserve Bank’s next generation data 
warehouse, viz., CIMS, was launched on June 30, 
2023 for reporting by SCBs. It was extended for 
data submission by other regulated entities [such 
as cooperative banks and non-banking financial 
companies (NBFCs)] in a phased manner. 
Several seminars, workshops and awareness sessions were organised for various stakeholders 
to ensure a smooth transition to the new system. 
X.66 In order to complement the regular 
urban household surveys, a new bi-monthly 
survey covering both consumer sentiments and 
expectations on major economic parameters 
is being conducted in rural and semi-urban 
areas on a pilot basis. The coverage of the rural 
consumer confidence survey (RCCS) has been 
gradually extended to 74 districts in 26 states/
union territories, involving over 8,000 households 
in each survey round. Data quality validation, 
including outlier detection techniques for banking 
returns, was refined on the basis of tree-based 
ML algorithms and deep learning methods as 
part of a toolbox with a user interface. Exploration 
of non-traditional data sources was enhanced 
to complement the existing statistical efforts. 
A natural language processing (NLP) and ML 
based system for regular tracking of business 
outlook from media communications by large 
corporates has been developed to complement 
the regular enterprise surveys. In-season periodic 
crop production assessment was also carried out 
for select major agricultural commodities using 
remote sensing data.
Other Initiatives
X.67 The frequency of the Basic Statistical 
Return - 2 (BSR-2), i.e., survey on deposits with 
SCBs excluding regional rural banks (RRBs) has 
been changed to quarterly from annual since 
the March 2023 round. Age-group distribution of 
individuals’ deposits has been introduced in BSR-
2 and information on the same is being released 
since the March 2023 round.
X.68 The comprehensive credit information 
repository (CCIR) system has been developed 
and it is ready for pilot runs with select SCBs. A 

COMMUNICATION, INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS,

manager module has been developed in CIMS. 
Element-based repository (EBR) has been 
developed, with about 1,000 data elements and 
related SDMX artefacts. 
X.69 Big data technologies, including AI/ML 
techniques, are increasingly being used to analyse 
unstructured and high frequency information 
to derive relevant results and support policy 
making. These, inter alia, include development of 
media sentiment indices for key macroeconomic 
indicators and regular assessments of the 
Reserve Bank’s policy communication through 
different channels, including media reception 
and impact on financial markets, by using NLP 
techniques.
X.70 The Department continued with its efforts 
to refine the methodologies for assessment and 
forecasting of key macroeconomic indicators. 
This, inter alia, included detailed analysis of 
inflation variations across states in view of 
repeated adverse supply shocks (please refer to

9. CONCLUSION
X.78 The Reserve Bank deployed multiple 
channels of communication covering a wide 
spectrum of audience to maintain and strengthen 
public confidence in its policy actions for a more 
effective policy implementation. The international 
economic and financial relations were deepened 
through regular engagement with the international 
organisations and multilateral bodies. The 
Reserve Bank organised several events to 
enhance public awareness about the G20 and 
India’s G20 Presidency priorities. An integrated 
framework was created for transfer of funds for 
centrally sponsored schemes (CSS) on a real 
time basis through gradual onboarding of all 
concerned stakeholders. The foreign exchange 
reserves, which provide cushion in managing  
the exchange rate volatility, were managed 
prudently. Economic research activities were 
sustained and sharpened by undertaking 
studies on a gamut of topical and emerging 
macroeconomic and financial issues. The 
statistics and information management system 
was further strengthened by upgrading data 
warehouse with state-of-the-art technologies. A 
robust legal framework for the financial sector 
was also ensured through relevant amendments

3. HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT 
INITIATIVES
XI.20  The Reserve Bank has a wide canvas of 
operations, requiring diversified skills and a robust 
set of internal capabilities to fulfil its mandate. 
The HRMD plays the role of an enabler and a 
facilitator to build and maintain an efficient and 
motivated workforce in the Reserve Bank. During 
the year, the Department continued its focus on 
upscaling the skillset through recruitment and 
training, including e-learning, and prioritised staff welfare. Major initiatives undertaken during the 
year in these, and other areas are highlighted 
below, along with a status of implementation of 
the agenda set for 2023-24 as also the agenda 
for 2024-25.
Agenda for 2023-24
XI.21  The Department had set out the following 
goals for 2023-24:
	●Installing a robust mechanism, guided 
by a well-distilled policy framework, for 
conducting town hall meetings for the 
employees of the Reserve Bank in all 
regional offices (Utkarsh 2.0) [Paragraph 
XI.22];
	●A comprehensive review of the RBI (Staff) 
Regulations,1948 which define the service 
conditions of all the employees of the 
Reserve Bank (Utkarsh 2.0) [Paragraph 
XI.23]; and 
	●In order to ensure a smoother on-
boarding process for all new recruits, the 
Department would draw up a reference 
booklet (Paragraph XI.24).
Implementation Status 
XI.22  A town hall initiative titled “Vartalap” has 
been launched as a measure for sustaining 
employee engagement on a continuous basis 
and to reinforce organisational values.
XI.23  A comprehensive review of the RBI (Staff) 
Regulations, 1948 has been undertaken to align 
the regulations with the current organisational 
realities and requirements. The proposed 
changes are being examined from a legal angle 
before adoption. 
XI.24  To smoothen the on-boarding process for 
all new recruits, a reference booklet has been 
prepared to help the new recruits navigate in their 
initial months.

GOVERNANCE, HUMAN RESOURCES AND
ORGANISATIONAL MANAGEMENT199Major Developments 
In-house Training
XI.25  The Reserve Bank gives emphasis on 
continuous skill enhancement and capacity 
building of its human capital. To meet this 
objective, the Reserve Bank has set up training 
establishments (TEs), viz., Reserve Bank 
Staff College (RBSC) at Chennai; College of 
Agricultural Banking (CAB) at Pune; four Zonal 
Training Centres (ZTCs) at Mumbai (Belapur), 
New Delhi, Kolkata and Chennai; College of 
Supervisors (CoS) at Mumbai; and RBI Academy 
at Mumbai. Recently, the Reserve Bank has also 
started conducting trainings for future oriented 
information technology (IT) related programmes 
under the aegis of Enterprise Computing and 
Cybersecurity Training Institute (ECCTI), for which a campus is being set up at Bhubaneswar. 
The programmes offered by the Reserve Bank’s 
TEs are in the format of trainings, workshops, 
seminars and conferences (Table XI.1). As a 
knowledge institution, the Reserve Bank fosters 
continuity in learning and development and 
ensures that it is in harmony with changing 
training needs and environment.
XI.26  The Reserve Bank’s training apparatus 
continues to focus on upgradation of technical and 
behavioural skills as also emotional intelligence 
of employees with a view to enhancing their 
efficiency and effectiveness. The initiatives of 
the Reserve Bank for enhancing awareness and 
capacity building for emotional intelligence are 
encapsulated in Box XI.1.

Enhancing Emotional Intelligence (EI) in the Reserve Bank
Emotional intelligence is considered as a game changer 
in ensuring the effectiveness of human resources at the 
workplace. The ability to identify one’s own as well as others’ 
emotions, regulate and appropriately express them to 
facilitate attainment of organisational objectives is emotional 
intelligence (EI). Daniel Goleman’s fourfold emotional 
competencies framework comprising self-awareness, self-
regulation, relationship management and empathy is the 
most widely accepted framework. Self-awareness and self-
regulation are considered as personal competencies while 
the latter two form social competencies. Self-regulation and 
empathy are indispensable to EI. The importance of EI is more pronounced at senior levels in the organisation. While 
the intelligence quotient (IQ) peaks at a younger age, EI can 
be enhanced at any point in life. 
Realising the need for initiative in the area of EI, the Reserve 
Bank has started conducting EI workshops for its senior 
executives and top management with the expectation 
that such initiatives would motivate leaders to inspire 
their team members to better understand the motivations 
and perspectives of other stakeholders, empower them 
to recognise and act on latent opportunities, pre-empt 
and resolve conflicts at an early stage and produce high 
performing teams.

GOVERNANCE, HUMAN RESOURCES AND
ORGANISATIONAL MANAGEMENT201welfare measures for employees. During 2023-
24, HRMD, Central Office held nine meetings with 
central units of recognised Unions/Associations. 
As per the extant instructions, regional offices 
(ROs) also held meetings with local units of 
recognised Trade Unions at quarterly/half yearly 
intervals.
Interface with Employees
XI.31  The Reserve Bank sustained its efforts 
towards developing a continuous listening culture 
with a view to involve employees, to harness their 
ideas and feedback to achieve the organisation’s 
purposes and goals. VOICE (Voicing Opinion to 
Inspire, Contribute, and Excel), the initiative of the 
Reserve Bank, provides a platform for employees 
to interact in a free-flowing format with the 
Department. During 2023-24, the Reserve Bank 
conducted 14 VOICE sessions, covering around 
295 participants from various ROs and the central 
office departments (CODs).
Recruitment and Staff Strength
XI.32 During 2023 (January-December), the 
Reserve Bank recruited a total of 882 employees 
in various cadres (Table XI.3). 
XI.33 The total staff strength of the Reserve 
Bank as on December 31, 2023 was 13,490, an 
increase of 1.4 per cent from the position as at 
end-December 2022 (Table XI.4). XI.34  The total strength of ex-servicemen in the 
Reserve Bank stood at 1,105 as on December 31,

based on the outcome of the analysis in a 
phased manner  (Utkarsh 2.0) [Paragraph 
XI.48]; 
	●Benchmarking the Reserve Bank’s 
cyber security controls based on known 
international standards (Utkarsh 2.0) 
[Paragraph XI.49];
	●Developing a liquidity-at-risk model for 
the forex  portfolio of the Reserve Bank  
(Utkarsh 2.0) [Paragraph XI.49];	●Operationalising a framework for 
assessment of emerging risks to the 
Reserve Bank’s objectives (Utkarsh 2.0) 
[Paragraph XI.49]; and
	●Operationalising a framework for fostering

(Utkarsh 2.0) [Paragraph XI.49].
Implementation Status 
XI.44  The incident reporting framework has 
been comprehensively revised, and a ‘Framework 
for Identification and Reporting of Risk Incidents 
(FIRRI)’ has been implemented in the Reserve 
Bank since November 20, 2023. The review of 
risk register framework is under process.
XI.45  The Handbook for risk officers in the 
form of a ‘Compendium of Instructions for Risk 
Officers’ was issued on July 24, 2023. The 
handbook encompasses all guidelines issued by 
RMD, including the roles and responsibilities of 
risk officers in various departments/offices of the 
Reserve Bank.
XI.46  The policies regarding formulation of key 
risk indicators for various business areas and a 
framework for management of transversal risks 
have been formulated.
XI.47  A review of extant VAPT policy has been 
carried out by the Department based on inputs 
received from various stakeholders, including 
application owner departments and auditors, 
among others. The suggestions received from the 
stakeholders have been incorporated in the draft 
policy, and the same are under examination.
XI.48  The Department conducted a study on the 
ERM practices being followed by several central 
banks and financial institutions worldwide, and 
1  Risks which result from activities/processes that are common to multiple business areas or whose materialisation could simultaneously 
impact different functions, areas, or activities, beyond the area or process in which the risk arises.

GOVERNANCE, HUMAN RESOURCES AND
ORGANISATIONAL MANAGEMENT205also the benchmark practices on ERM prescribed 
under the COSO2 - ERM Framework (2017) and 
ISO 31000 - Risk Management Guidelines (2018). 
The results of the study are being integrated in 
the review of the ERM framework of the Reserve 
Bank. 
XI.49  The study on the alignment of the cyber 
security controls with the National Institute of 
Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity 
Framework was carried out in the Department. A 
liquidity adjusted expected shortfall (LAES) model 
for assessment of liquidity risk in the forex bonds 
portfolio has been developed and implemented. 
An emerging risk scanning framework for 
early assessment of emerging risks that could potentially impact the achievement of the Reserve 
Bank’s mandates, has been formulated and is 
under finalisation. A framework for fostering the 
risk culture in the Reserve Bank, comprising a risk 
culture policy and a risk culture self-assessment 
framework, has been implemented.
Other Initiatives
Examining the Use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in 
the Reserve Bank
XI.50 Risk management being integral to the 
working of central banks, the Reserve Bank 
is exploring possible applications of artificial 
intelligence (AI) to manage the complete lifecycle 
of risk management (Box XI.2). 
2 The Committee of Sponsoring Organisations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) is a voluntary private-sector organisation, established 
in the United States, dedicated to providing guidance to executive management and governance entities on critical aspects of organisational 
governance, business ethics, internal control, enterprise risk management, fraud, and financial reporting. COSO has established a common 
internal control model against which companies and organisations may assess their control systems.Box XI.2 
Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Risk Management
The world is at a critical cross-road with artificial intelligence 
based cutting-edge tools/technologies turning out to be the 
harbinger of change in several real-world applications. 
Machine learning and deep learning, synonymous with AI, 
have become essential value-creating tools, enhancing 
operational efficiency in various processes and functions. Central banks are also leveraging applications of AI as 
an input to policy making and supervisory processes 
and as a key technology-based force multiplier  
(Table I). Additionally, application of AI is being explored 
in the fields of market infrastructure and payments, cash 
management and operations, human resources, legal

ANNUAL REPORT 2023-24206Outsourcing Risk Management Policy
XI.51 The Reserve Bank has implemented an 
enterprise-wide outsourcing risk management 
policy, which provides guidance on management 
of outsourcing risks and covers various aspects 
of risk management relating to vendor/service 
provider such as risk assessment from outsourced 
activities, due diligence and selection, outsourcing 
agreement, confidentiality and security of data, 
ongoing monitoring and control of outsourced 
activities, performance standards and sub-
contracting.
Agenda for 2024-25
XI.52  For 2024-25, the following goals have 
been proposed for the Department:
	●Analysis of the approved risk tolerance 
limits (RTLs) of all business areas will be 
undertaken to identify the inter-linkages 
and subsequent harmonisation of similar 
RTLs across departments;	●Revision of Information Security Policy, 
2022 of the Reserve Bank will be carried 
out in order to fine-tune the present 
version of the policy and to provide 
necessary guidance in view of rapidly  
evolving technological adoption of AI, 
cloud and advanced analytics;
	●Balance sheet stress testing will be 
undertaken with reference to simultaneous 
movement of exchange rate and interest 
rate based on scenarios derived from 
historical periods of market stress, 
augmented by forward-looking stress 
scenarios; 
	●Adopting international best practices of 
ERM (Utkarsh 2.0); and
	●Assessment of emerging risks in the 
Reserve Bank (Utkarsh 2.0).and information systems, business continuity, audit, and 
analytics. 
Globally, traditional risk management areas like credit risk 
management (default/downgrade predictions), market risk 
management (volatility analysis), asset allocation, portfolio 
risk optimisation, scenario and sensitivity analysis have 
already seen significant advancement in the usage of AI-
based tools. Moving forward, the application of AI can have 
a profound positive impact on the complete lifecycle of risk 
management, considering the ability of AI-based tools to 
analyse voluminous data and identify patterns, facilitating 
data-driven proactive risk management. 
AI can be used for analysis of reported risk incidents or 
aggregation of audit observations across various control 
functions to identify trends/patterns/potential vulnerabilities. 
Other potential AI applications in risk management include 
control self-assessment, use of chatbots for assistance 
in risk reporting, building institutional memory on past 
responses to risk incidents, quality checks, identification of redundancies, and providing relevant guidance for 
implementation of risk tools. Usage of AI could also 
contribute to improving operational resilience of central 
banks through cyber threat-hunting and surveillance 
and through cloud-based tools for business continuity 
management.
The predictive capabilities of AI can also strengthen 
assessment of risks in relatively newer areas for central 
banks such as identification of emerging risks in the 
broader financial system, third-party risk evaluation, and 
climate and natural disaster risk assessment.

THE RESERVE BANK’S ACCOUNTS FOR 2023-24219INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT
To,
The President of India 
Report on Audit of Financial Statements of the Reserve Bank of India 
Opinion
We, the undersigned Auditors of the Reserve Bank of India (hereinafter referred to as the “Bank”), do hereby report to the 
Central Government upon the Balance Sheet of the Bank as on March 31, 2024 and the Income Statement for the year ended 
on that date (hereinafter referred to as “Financial Statements”), which have been audited by us.
In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to explanations given to us and as shown by the books of 
accounts of the Bank, the Balance Sheet read with Schedules and Significant Accounting Policies is a full and fair Balance 
Sheet containing all necessary particulars and is properly drawn up in accordance with the requirements of the provisions of 
the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934 (“RBI Act, 1934”) and Regulations framed there under so as to exhibit true and correct 
view of the state of affairs of the Bank as on March 31, 2024 and its results of operations for the year ended on that date.
Basis for Opinion 
We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (“SAs”) issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants 
of India (“ICAI”). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit 
of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Bank in accordance with the ethical requirements 
that are relevant to our audit of the Financial Statements, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance 
with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis 
for our opinion on the Financial Statements. 
Information Other than the Financial Statements and Auditor’s Report Thereon
The Management is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the 
Notes to Accounts but does not include the Financial Statements and our report thereon. 
Our opinion on the Financial Statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance 
conclusion thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the Financial Statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, 
consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the Financial Statements or our knowledge obtained in 
the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is 
a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. 
We have nothing to report in this regard.
Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Financial Statements
The Bank’s Management and those Charged with Governance for the Financial Statements are responsible for the preparation 
of the Financial Statements that give a true and correct view of the state of affairs and results of operations of the Bank 
in accordance with the requirements of the provisions of the RBI Act, 1934 and Regulations framed thereunder and the 
accounting policies and practices followed by the Bank. This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting 
records and preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting 
policies; making judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent and the design, implementation and maintenance 
of internal control relevant to the preparation and presentation of the Financial Statements that give a true and correct view 
and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
As per the RBI Act, 1934, the Bank can be liquidated only by the Central Government by order and in any other manner as it 
may direct. Also, while the fundamental basis of preparation of Financial Statements of the Bank are based on provisions of the 
RBI Act, 1934 and Regulations framed thereunder, the Management has adopted the accounting policies and practices which 
reflects its continuity as a Going concern.
Those charged with governance are also responsible for overseeing the Bank’s financial reporting process.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Financial Statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance 

ANNUAL REPORT 2023-24220is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material 
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in 
the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these 
financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout 
the audit. We also: 
•	Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the Financial Statements, whether due to fraud or error, design 
and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to 
provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one 
resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of 
internal control. 
•	Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate 
in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Bank’s internal financial 
control. 
•	Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related 
disclosures made by the Management. 
•	Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the Going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit 
evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on 
the Bank’s ability to continue as a Going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw 
attention in our auditors’ report to the related disclosures in the Financial Statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, 
to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors’ report. 
•	Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the Financial Statements, and whether the Financial Statements 
represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the 
audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements 
regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to 
bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
Other Matters
We report that we have called for information and explanations from the Bank considered necessary for the purpose of our 
audit and such information and explanations have been given to our satisfaction. 
We also report that the Financial Statements include the accounts of twenty-five accounting units of the Bank which have been 
audited by Statutory Branch Auditors and we have relied on their report in this regard.

The Financial Statements are prepared 
in accordance with the RBI Act, 1934 and  
notifications issued thereunder and, in the form, 
prescribed by the Reserve Bank of India General 
Regulations, 1949. These are based on historical 
cost except where it is modified to reflect 
revaluation and/ or amortisation. The accounting 
policies followed in preparing financial statements 
are consistent with those followed in the previous 
year unless otherwise stated.
2.2 Revenue Recognition
a) Income and expenditure are recognised on 
accrual basis except penal interest charged 
from banks which is accounted for only when 
there is certainty of realisation. Dividend 
income on shares is recognised on accrual 
basis when the right to receive the same is 
established. 
b) Balances unclaimed and outstanding 
for more than three clear consecutive 
accounting years in certain transit accounts 
including Drafts Payable Account, Payment 

THE RESERVE BANK’S ACCOUNTS FOR 2023-24227Orders Account, Sundry Deposit Account-
Miscellaneous-BD, Remittance Clearance 
Account, Earnest Money Deposit Account 
and Security Deposit Account are reviewed 
and written back to income. Claims, if any, 
are considered and charged against income 
in the year of payment.
c) Income and expenditure in foreign currency 
are recorded at exchange rates prevailing 
on the day.
d) Exchange gains/ losses on sale of foreign 
currencies and gold are accounted for 
using the weighted average cost method for 
arriving at the cost.
2.3 Gold & Foreign Currency Assets and 
Liabilities
Transactions in gold & foreign currency assets 
and liabilities are accounted for on settlement 
date basis.
a) Gold
 Gold (including gold deposit) is revalued on 
a daily basis at ninety (90) per cent of the 
London Bullion Market Association (LBMA) 
gold price in US dollar and Rupee-US dollar 
market exchange rate. Unrealised valuation 
gains/ losses are accounted for in Currency 
and Gold Revaluation Account (CGRA).
b) Foreign Currency Assets and Liabilities
 All foreign currency assets and liabilities 
(excluding foreign currency received under 
swaps that are in the nature of repos 
and contracts where the rates are fixed 
contractually) are translated on a daily basis 
at market exchange rates prevailing on the 
day. Unrealised gains/ losses arising from 
such translation of foreign currency assets 
and liabilities are accounted for in CGRA. Foreign securities, other than Treasury Bills 
(T-Bills), Commercial Papers and certain  
‘Held to Maturity’ securities [such as 
investments in notes issued by the 
International Monetary Fund and bonds 
issued by India Infrastructure Finance 
Company (IIFC), UK which are valued at 
cost] are marked-to-market on a daily basis. 
Unrealised gains/ losses on revaluation 
are recorded in ‘Investment Revaluation 
Account-Foreign Securities’ (IRA-FS). Credit 
balance in IRA-FS is carried forward to 
subsequent accounting year. Debit balance 
in IRA-FS, if any, on the balance sheet date, 
is charged to Contingency Fund (CF) and 
the same is reversed on the first working day 
of the following accounting year.
 Foreign T-Bills and Commercial Papers 
are carried at cost as adjusted by daily 
amortisation of discount/ premium. Premium 
or discount on foreign securities is amortised 
daily. Profit/ loss on sale of foreign securities 
is recognised with respect to the amortised 
book value.
c) Forward/Swap Contracts
 Forward contracts entered into by the 
Reserve Bank are revalued on a half-yearly 
basis. While mark-to-market net gain is 
credited to ‘Foreign Exchange Forward 
Contracts Valuation Account’ (FCVA) with 
contra debit to ‘Revaluation of Forward 
Contracts Account’ (RFCA), mark-to-market 
net loss is debited to FCVA with contra 
credit to ‘Provision for Forward Contracts 
Valuation Account’ (PFCVA). On maturity of 
the contract, actual gain or loss is recognised 
in the income account and unrealised  
gains/ losses previously recorded in FCVA, 

ANNUAL REPORT 2023-24228RFCA and PFCVA are reversed. At the time 
of half-yearly revaluation, balance in FCVA 
and RFCA or PFCVA as on that day is 
reversed and fresh revaluation is done for 
all outstanding forward contracts.
 Debit balance in FCVA, if any, on the balance 
sheet date, is charged to CF and reversed 
on the first working day of the following 
accounting year. The balance in RFCA and 
PFCVA represents net unrealised gains and 
losses, respectively, on valuation of forward 
contracts.
 In case of swaps at off-market rates that are 
in the nature of repo, the difference between 
future contract rate and the rate at which the 
contract is entered into is amortised over 
the period of the contract and recorded in 
income account with contra entry in ‘Swap 
Amortisation Account’ (SAA). Amounts 
recorded in SAA are reversed on maturity 
of underlying contracts. Further, amounts 
received under these swaps are not subject 
to periodic revaluation.
 While FCVA forms part of ‘Revaluation 
Accounts’, PFCVA forms part of ‘Other 
Liabilities’ and RFCA and SAA forms part of 
‘Other Assets’.

incurred. 
2.7.2 Land	 and	Buildings: Accounting treatment 
in respect of land and buildings is as follows: 
a) Land
 i. Land acquired on leasehold basis for a 
period of more than 99 years is treated

and accordingly, not subjected to 
amortisation. 
 ii. Land acquired on lease up to 99 years is 
amortised over the period of lease. 
 iii. Land acquired on a freehold basis is not 
subject to any amortisation.
b) Buildings

(where the lease period is less than 
thirty years) depreciation is charged 
on ‘straight-line’ basis over the lease 
period of the land.
 ii. Impairment of buildings: For assessment 
of impairment, buildings are classified 
into two categories, as under:● Buildings which are in use but 
have been identified for demolition 
in future or will be discarded in 
future: The value in use of such 
buildings is the aggregate of 
depreciation for the future period 
up to the date it is expected to 
be discarded/ demolished. The 
difference between the book value 
and aggregate of depreciation 
so arrived at, is charged as 
depreciation. 
● Buildings which have been 
discarded/ vacated: These buildings 
are shown at realisable value (net 
selling price if the asset is likely  
to be sold in future) or scrap value 
less demolition cost (if it is to be 
demolished). If the resultant amount 
is negative, then the carrying  
value of such buildings is shown 
at ₹1. The difference between 
book value and realisable value 
(net selling price)/ scrap value 
less demolition cost is charged as 
depreciation.

The Reserve Bank makes risk provisioning in 
terms of Section 47 of the RBI Act, 1934. Risk 
provisions maintained by the Reserve Bank

along with Capital and Reserve Fund, are 
components of the Reserve Bank’s Available 
Realised Equity (ARE) under the Economic 
Capital Framework1 (ECF) adopted by the 
Reserve Bank. Details of Capital and Reserve 
Fund have been given in earlier paragraphs. 
Details of the two risk provisions are as under:
a. Contingency Fund (CF)
 This is a specific provision meant for meeting 
unexpected and unforeseen contingencies, 
including depreciation in value of securities, 
risks arising out of monetary/ exchange rate 
policy operations, systemic risks and any risk 
arising on account of special responsibilities 
enjoined upon the Reserve Bank. As on 
March 31, 2024, amounts of ₹1,43,220.82

THE RESERVE BANK’S ACCOUNTS FOR 2023-24233crore and ₹7,090.29 crore were charged to 
CF on account of debit balances in IRA-FS 
and IRA-RS, respectively. The charge to CF is 
reversed on first working day of the following 
accounting year. Further, an amount of 
₹42,819.91 crore was also provided towards 
CF to maintain the Available Realised Equity 
at the level of 6.50 per cent of the size of 
the balance sheet. Accordingly, balance in 
CF as on March 31, 2024 was ₹4,28,621.03 
crore as compared to ₹3,51,205.69 crore as 
on March 31, 2023.

2024, the balance in ADF at ₹22,974.68 
crore remains the same as on March 31, 
2023 (Table XII.2).XII.6.6 Revaluation Accounts
Unrealised marked-to-market gains/ losses are 
recorded in revaluation heads, viz., Currency and 
Gold Revaluation Account (CGRA), Investment 
Revaluation Accounts (IRA) and Foreign 
Exchange Forward Contracts Valuation Account 
(FCVA). Details of the same are given here:
a. Currency and Gold Revaluation Account 
(CGRA)
 Major sources of market risk faced by the 
Reserve Bank are currency risk, interest 
rate risk and movement in gold prices. 
Unrealised gains/ losses on valuation of 
Foreign Currency Assets (FCA) and Gold 
are not taken to income account but instead 
accounted for in CGRA. Net balance in 
CGRA, therefore, varies with size of the 
asset base, its valuation and movement 
in exchange rate and price of gold. CGRA 
provides a buffer against exchange 
rate/ gold price fluctuations. It can come 
under pressure if there is an appreciation of 
rupee vis-à-vis major currencies or a fall in

AnnouncementPolicy Initiative
June 26, 2023 As part of the convergence of the Reserve Bank’s guidelines with the revised Basel Committee 
on Banking Supervision (BCBS) standards on operational risk, the Master Direction on ‘Minimum 
Capital Requirements for Operational Risk’ was issued to all commercial banks [excluding local area 
banks, payments banks, regional rural banks (RRBs) and small finance banks]. The Master Direction 
prescribes the new standardised approach (Basel III standardised approach) for operational risk 
capital calculation. It overcomes the conceptual weakness of the existing basic indicator approach 
(BIA) by requiring banks to consider: (a) a financial statement-based business indicator component

September 13, 2023 Directions were issued to banks and other lenders, including NBFCs, housing finance companies and 
cooperative banks, to release all original movable or immovable property documents within 30 days 
of full repayment or settlement of personal loans by borrowers. In case of delay, the lenders will have 
to compensate the borrowers by paying ₹5,000 for each day of delay. The Directions, released as 
part of responsible lending conduct, will be applicable to all cases where release of original property 
documents is due on or after December 1, 2023. In the event of loss of or damage to original property 
documents, either in part or in full, the lender will have to assist the borrower in obtaining duplicate 
or certified copies of the documents and will have to bear the associated costs. This cost will be 
in addition to the daily compensation of ₹5,000 for each day of delay. However, in such cases, an

based on external ratings; (iii) enable broad-based capturing of market risk instead of the simplified 
approach followed currently, and the recognition of operational risk of AIFIs; (iv) facilitate more efficient 
capturing of off-balance sheet exposures of AIFIs, under the leverage ratio framework; and (v) bring 
about the applicability of large exposure framework (LEF) to AIFIs, thus setting prudent limits to their 
large exposures. The Master Direction is applicable with effect from April 1, 2024.

November 16, 2023 Post COVID-19, credit offtake towards the consumer credit segment has been quite substantial. Also, 
increasing dependency of NBFCs on bank borrowings was leading to regulatory concerns. Although 
asset quality at broader portfolio level was not exhibiting any major signs of stress, the consistent high 
credit growth reported in the above segments warranted a prudential intervention. Hence, to pre-empt 
build-up of any potential risk from interconnectedness and excessive credit growth in these segments, 
the Reserve Bank issued a circular on regulatory measures towards consumer credit and bank credit 
to NBFCs dated November 16, 2023. The measures included higher risk weights for such exposure as 
also tighter exposure limits. These measures are likely to reduce build-up of vulnerabilities in consumer 
credit segment.

December 19, 2023 Certain instances of regulatory arbitrage through investments in alternate investment funds (AIFs) by 
the REs were observed. This route was used for evergreening of stressed assets, resulting in under 
provisioning and less resilient balance sheets of REs. With a view to addressing these concerns, vide 
circular dated December 19, 2023, following measures were taken: (a) REs shall not invest in any 
of the AIF schemes which has downstream investment, excluding the equity investments, in any of 
the debtor companies of the concerned RE. This also excludes investments by REs in AIFs through 
intermediaries such as fund of funds or mutual funds; (b) REs shall liquidate their existing investments 
in AIFs within a stipulated period of 30-days if AIF scheme had invested or invests in RE’s debtor 
company, failing which REs shall proportionately provide for their investments in AIFs; and (c) REs 
have also been mandated that any investment in junior tranche, irrespective of the motive of such 
investment, will be deducted in full, from its regulatory capital fund. These measures would prevent 
the regulatory arbitrage employed by certain REs by investing through AIF route. Further, in order 
to ensure consistency in implementing of the circular, clarifications were issued on March 27, 2024 
advising that: (i) downstream investments exclude equity shares but include other investments as 
per paragraph 2(i) of the circular; (ii) provisioning applies only to extent of RE’s investment in the AIF 
scheme, not the entire investment; (iii) compliance with paragraph 2 of the circular is necessary if the 
AIF lacks downstream investment in a debtor company; (iv) proposed deductions from capital affect 
both Tier-1 and Tier-2 capital, encompassing all forms of subordinated exposures including sponsor 
units; and (v) investments in AIFs through intermediaries such as fund of funds or mutual funds are 
beyond the circular’s scope.
